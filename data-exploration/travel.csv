I'm 33 traveling with my wife 31. Ive been to Europe a few times but have spent very little time in Spain. I'm meeting some friends for Oktoberfest in Munich next year at the end of September. Here's the plan so far. 15 nights. 

-	Flight into Munich for 3 nights 
-	Flight to Madrid to spend 3 nights 
-	Granada for 2 nights (I've heard great things but I'm torn between Granda and Seville? Are these two similar? 
-	Flight to Mallorca to spend 3 nights. I'd love to see a beautiful Mediterranean island in Spain. 
-	Flight to Barcelona for 4 nights and fly home from here. 

Sincerely would love your feedback. We both love Tuscan cities and would both lean toward charming towns and cities with beautiful history over more modern architecture. Both love great food and good drinks. I'm so excited to spend time with Spanish culture I've heard the people are wonderful.",2022-12-18 05:20:52

Background: I am not an avid traveler and with my commitments, I barely get time to travel. Since I have never been to South America, I decided to travel to Chile for a week over Christmas. Here is what I have planned so far. I can always extend my trip for a day or two if you guys think it’s too ambitious. And I can cut back on activities as well.

Day 1: Arrive in Santiago and explore the city
Day 2: Bus to Valparaiso, explore the city, and then back to Santiago
Day 3: Flight to Calama and then shuttle to San Pedro de Atacama. Catch the sunset at Moon Valley and then night stay at San Pedro de Atacama.
Day 4: Early start - Tatio Geysers, then Puritama hot springs. Rest for a couple of hours. Tour out to Laguna Chaxa + Laguna Tebinquinche.
Day 5: Flight from Calama to Punta Arenas. Speed boat to Magdalena Island. Bus to Puerto Natales.
Day 6: Estancia La Peninsula (one day tour) + dinner at the Singular Patagonia.
Day 7: Rental Car to Torres Del Paine. 1 day hike up to the three towers. Drive back to Puerto Natales and rest for the night.
Day 8: flight to santiago and then back home.

Also, if you guys have any experience with Moon Valley, how did you get there? I am seeing horseback tours that are 5 hours but there aren’t too many details online. Also is it possible to get a guide or join a tour for that trek in Torres del Paine? I am okay going solo everywhere but I think a tour guide might be really helpful for this hike.

Party / sightseeing trip in Europe starting in Copenhagen and finishing in Budapest... but need help deciding where to between Berlin and Prague for 5 days?,0,zo918o,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zo918o/party_sightseeing_trip_in_europe_starting_in/,5,1671292005.0,"Hi! I’m planning a big party / sightseeing trip that will be starting in Copenhagen and finishing off in Budapest. The main two priorities of the trip will be partying and also seeing famous sights and tourist attractions. So far my itinerary looks like this:

1. Copenhagen 3 nights

2. Hamburg 3 nights

3. Berlin 5 nights

4. *unknown* 5 nights

5. Prague 3 nights

6. Bratislava 2 nights (Bratislava instead of Vienna because Vienna apparently isn’t a good party city at al and Wild Elephants Hostel in Bratislava is supposed to be a top party hostel)

7. Budapest 4 nights

For the 5 unknown nights I have three options in mind:

Option 1: after Berlin train to Warsaw (2 nights), and then train to Krakow (3 nights). And then flight to Prague from Krakow. (But I don’t ideally want the stress of getting flights to and from destinations on this itinerary. But Krakow and Warsaw appear to be like really fun party cities with very interesting history.)

Option 2: After Berlin, 2 nights in Leipzig and then 3 nights in Munich, then off to Prague. But are Leipzig and Munich the party destinations I’m looking for? It appears not, but I would love to try some Munich beer!

Option 3: Add some extra days onto cities already on the list for day trips. Perhaps 2 extra nights to Prague for day trips to both Dresden and Pilsen? Perhaps and extra day onto Bratislava for a day trip to Vienna? Maybe an extra night in Berlin? Not too sure 

It would be really great to hear your thoughts and opinions? Thanks!",2022-12-17 17:46:45

Some context: Will be flying out of Houston and would have to leave AFTER Christmas to spend time with family and get back at or before January 7th.

I know most people prefer doing Europe on your own so advice on where to find flights and best itineraries to see the most in a short period of time would be helpful as well.

Do you struggle to explain your fascination with travel?,12,zo179d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zo179d/do_you_struggle_to_explain_your_fascination_with/,38,1671263152.0,"Delete if not allowed. 

So few years ago I decided to invest my free time and money into travel as i got obsessed with it, guess I caught the travel bug.

I stopped buying so many clothes as I had so many I couldn’t shut my wardrobe, latest video games or gadgets that I would play with for couple of hours and never again and being lucky enough to live in London and have access to budget airlines I go travelling on short 2-3 day breaks once a month. 

Every time I try and explain my passion for travel to people and the fact that I go away once a month just baffles people to the point that they just think am weird. 

I had someone tell me they’re so well travelled because they’ve been to Italy 12 times and also once to Greece, Spain and Portugal where as I’ve hit 50 countries. 

Obviously online you read travel blogs and can have discussions with like minded people, but just wondering if anyone who is well travelled like this ever faced that problem, or is there actually a point where someone saying that you’re weird for getting into this obsession warranted. Even my own parents don’t get it.

EDIT: I think the question stems from the fact that because almost all of my free time is invested in planning travel or travelling, a lot of my general conversations are either small talk or turn into a travel story and i am struggling to find people in real life as opposed to someone on TikTok who understand that kick for travelling.",2022-12-17 09:45:52

Getting a refund from Travelocity: How dumb am I?,2,zo09mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zo09mn/getting_a_refund_from_travelocity_how_dumb_am_i/,4,1671259458.0,"Reading through this sub, it seems like the answer I'm gonna get is ""Don't book with 3rd party sites"", which now seems like good advice that I'll heed for the rest of my days.

I booked a room with Travelocity and absentmindedly selected the wrong days. I just chose the 2 nearest dates (it's the middle of the night, so in my head the day is over) not realizing I was booking for \*right now\*, and should have been booking for tomorrow and the next day.

In my confirmation email it showed the day of the week, which clued me in, so I immediately called the hotel thinking maybe we could just let the payment for 2 nights stand, and have them mark the correct dates in their system. The woman on the phone was nice, but requested I try canceling through Travelocity first. When I clicked the ""cancel"" button, I was pleasantly surprised to see $435 (the full amount) shown as my refund amount. I thanked her, said it was taken care of, hung up, and accepted the cancellation and refund.

Unfortunately on the next page, the amount changed, now showing $217.96, only half a refund. So after a back and forth between the hotel and Travelocity, there's no resolution and I was told to wait 72 hours for my support ticket to be answered.

So I guess my question here: Does anyone have a similar experience, and were you able to get a refund? Tried disputing with credit card? (I used my Chase Unlimited, probably not the best). Anything else I should be doing? Thanks! $217 just seems a bit steep for a mis-click.",2022-12-17 08:44:18

Post Corona Traveling in Western Countries,1,znxn7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/znxn7h/post_corona_traveling_in_western_countries/,9,1671249896.0,"
Hey guys,

I‘m currently in Australia.
I‘ve been saving up for what was supposed to be a 2 year long journey for 3 years now and I was really excited for it. 

Now that I‘m here, I feel like it was a terrible decision and I should‘ve waited a couple more years for things to maybe cool down. 
Let me explain:

I am aware that December is the most expensive month for travelers since it‘s the start of summer around here, but the prices are absolutely insane.
I‘m lucky enough to have found a place where I can house sit for three weeks, but besides that, I’m having a tough time finding accommodation. I either pay 40€ a night for a hostel room that I share with 9 other people or I pay 10€ more to have an AirBnB to myself. 

While I usually really like hostels because they have a great vibe and I always meet awesome people there, for that amount of money, the choice is pretty clear. I spend almost the same amount and have a kitchen, bathroom and a King sized bed all to myself. And I can also sleep better, knowing that my belongings won’t be stolen. 

Don’t get me wrong, in Central and South America I’d always choose hostels over everything. 7-15€ for one night? Amazing! 
But this is the same reason why I currently regret not going there instead.
I was hoping to buy a car here in which I could sleep at least but no chance. 

Lastly I’m also having a tough time making friends here. While Aussies seem friendly and chatty at first, they just become uninterested very quickly. It’s always the same. Someone approaches me or vice versa, we exchange a few sentences and that’s about it. I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong, maybe that’s just the norm around here but I’ve never had that happen to me in any other country before.
I would always start talking to someone and we’d end up walking through the city for hours, getting some food and drinks and then exchange numbers. Not here tough.
Is that normal? Should I change something about myself?

What are your experiences? Should I just try to enjoy some months here and then move the trip to some other time before I waste too much of my savings? Because at the moment, the guilt of paying so much is just higher than the joy I get out of anything here. 

Cheers!",2022-12-17 06:04:56

Halfway down in a remote part of Baja, I started to feel woozy/sick so stopped at a hotel for the night. The next day I got violently ill. I’m really not sure if it was food poisoning or what, but I puked for like 24hrs straight and coincidentally the area was hit by a hurricane at the same time. I told the hotel desk I might need to get to a hospital and was told all the roads had been washed away by the hurricane. This really freaked me out as I was starting to get concerned about dehydration and malnourishment (still could barely keep anything down) and I ended up laid up in bed for another two days waiting for the road repairs. I remained so feeble I could hardly walk around.

Eventually I got out but the trip back up felt like a fight for survival. I was constantly experiencing spells of hypertension, wooziness, cold sweats etc. In the months since I have continued to have strong physical symptoms and my doctors are basically telling me these are symptoms of anxiety. It’s possible I suppose and I wonder if what I experienced was a sort of panic attack.

Never in a million fucking years would I have imagined something like this would happen to me. I am a seasoned motorcyclist and third world solo traveler. I went into that trip with so much confidence and excitement and since then, I feel afraid to even go on particularly long drives from my house. Any sort of trip that would take me to a place where I couldn’t be immediately whisked away to a hospital makes me feel nervous.

It’s marked a turning point in my desire to travel and I just feel so discouraged. I can’t tell you how much of a departure my current mentality is from how I felt before that trip- I am (was?) a really adventurous person who always jumped into new experiences with both feet. I’ve done intense trips like that many times before and even when things went terribly wrong I was always the one everybody relied on to take it all with a laugh and a smile.

I had been saving up for a long time to travel around the world which has been a dream of mine since I was little. Now I can’t even imagine doing so.

I guess I’m just venting or wondering if anybody has had similar experiences or advice.",2022-12-17 03:30:53

Log cabins,1,znu7e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/znu7e9/log_cabins/,2,1671238731.0,"
Hi all!

I am trying to plan a trip for my father’s 70th birthday. I need help because while I know what I want, I don’t know where I want.

I want to rent a log cabin for my dad. For whatever reason he just loves log cabins. I also think he’d like to enjoy the cool mountains and take a break from golf courses and the hot, hot Florida heat. I will also rent a car. 

Having a little town near by would be nice so we can go out to eat and peruse little shops. Other attractions near by would be a bonus. While we all appreciate the outdoors, none of us are hikers. It’s more about the scenery. We would consider day activities.

There must be major airport close by. Four people will be flying in from three cities and I’d like us all to have direct  flights. The smallest airport we will be flying in from is RSW. 

I’d like the cabin to be within a 40-minute drive. While I’ll rent a car, I don’t want to have to drive another 3+ hours from the airport to get to the cabin.

Timeframe - 5 days in March or April 

I’m open as far as destinations in the US. And if it’s not in a mountain or not super cool temp that’s okay too. Just somewhere that feels more rustic. I would really like to stick with a log cabin if possible. But if not, a place where we can just have a good time and enjoy a little bit of the outdoors. Ideas that sound about right to based on only things I have heard from others: Broken Bow, OK; Colorado; Dollywood; Tennessee… not sure about logistics though. 

Any ideas greatly welcomed - thanks!",2022-12-17 02:58:51

My husband, teenage daughter, and I live in Colorado. We've never traveled internationally, just throughout the U.S.  It's incredible to me considering that my husband and I are a half-century old that we've never done it. We are thinking of taking a 2-week trip this next year, early summer, and are having an *exceptionally* hard time deciding where in THE WORLD to go. My husband and I are outdoorsy, love nature, good food, biking, hiking and can't tolerate crowds or shopping. We aren't into big cities and prefer less populated, quaint areas. We love the sea for viewing, not swimming or snorkling. A nice bike path by the sea, hiking, quaint/interesting towns/villages with excellent food would be heaven to us. (No cruises!) My teenage daughter is not so outdoorsy, but won't complain about biking/hiking if we keep it casual. She loves the sea. Good food. Fun activites for a teen. She's artsy.  We've talked about Ireland, the Meditterean Sea, Thailand (the flight time - good lord, but man do I want to visit!), or just doing the Vancouver/Vancouver Island trip we'd had planned for May of 2020 but had to cancel because of the pandemic. I've been reading the r/travel posts for a short while now and I'm completely envious of all the folks who are able to travel regulary (or internationally at all, really). We don't know where to start and this may be the only international trip we take with our daughter before she heads off to college. (We *might* be able to sqeeze in two trips.) We've got to make it good - super memorable and worth the money. If anyone has any thoughts, we'd greatly appreciate the input. Thanks!!!

I am planning on visiting Amsterdam sometime in April 2023. My group will be visiting for probably 4 days max (including a day trip to the Keukenhof gardens to see the tulips). We have a total of 8-9 days allotted for the trip and were hoping to visit another place in Europe for the remaining few days. Our main interests are general sightseeing/history, food (although not snobbish about this), shopping, and people watching. Love walkable areas and squares with stores and coffee shops/restaurants. Accessibility from Amsterdam by train is preferred but we are okay with flying if needed. We have been to Paris a couple times so would prefer to avoid it.

Some destination ideas to pair with our Amsterdam trip are:

* Copenhagen: seems similar to Amsterdam but more expensive (but okay with our budget). Wouldn't mind flying since it's a bit further away. Not sure if the weather will be worse since it's more north. 
* Belgium: honestly not my #1 choice but easy given the location. I would skip Brussels based on what I've read and focus on Ghent, Bruges, and maybe Antwerp(?).
* Stay in Netherlands and check out nearby areas such as Utrecht
* Western Germany: Hamburg (with day trip to Bremen)? Other German place? We've been to Munich already and are saving Berlin for a later trip
* London: feel neutral about this since I was recently there not too long ago

"Woah, I won’t choose American Airlines again.",0,znqpnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/znqpnh/woah_i_wont_choose_american_airlines_again/,12,1671228984.0,"Hey friends, this is partly a vent, partly a PSA, and an ask for suggestions. 

I’m sharing my annoyance for folks who may be considering getting a credit card to benefit from accruing airline miles and am hoping to offer insight so you can avoid what feels like purposeful consumer manipulation. 

I was booking two flight tickets on American. One was to be paid for by an American Airlines credit card, the other was purchased by redeeming miles accrued by using that same credit card. 

The credit card purchase was made in 15 minutes. 

The mileage redemption process took 4 hours because the website continued to “experience problems”. 

Without rehashing the multiple transfers to increasingly incompetent customer service agents, the call being sent to a customer service satisfaction survey prior to the transaction being completed, the repeated calls to the American Airlines credit card helpline and general repeating of the increasingly frustrating story, I’ll simply state my conclusion. 

If you pay using a credit card, the website and the customer service staff are polite, effective and efficient. 

If you are attempting to redeem miles the website is problematic and the customer service agents are less skilled. 

I’m confident that this is intentional and designed to frustrate the user into simply paying and not redeeming miles. It’s a fine example of weaponized incompetence. 

This will be my last flight with American. 

My plan is to use United. Does anyone have advice or experience with their mileage redemption process?",2022-12-17 00:16:24

KLM Won't Offer Full EC261 Compensation,0,znh7z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/znh7z8/klm_wont_offer_full_ec261_compensation/,5,1671204440.0,"I'd love input and others experiences with this.

In October, my wife and I were in Europe (Switzerland), and our flight back to the U.S. was canceled, and we were put on a new flight which left a day earlier than we planned. We had to cut our honeymoon a day short due to this change and we were not notified in any way. The only reason I found out at all was because I checked the app on a whim 3 days prior to our departure. 

We got home and I filed a claim with KLM/Delta requesting 600 Euros of compensation each, which is the entitlement under EC261.

They responded and said because we arrived back home without a technical delay (since we left a day early) we were only entitled to half the compensation at 300 euros each. 

Upon further reading, it seems like the CJEU ruled in 2021, that if the flight is brought forward by more than an hour, airlines cannot reduce the compensation on the grounds that we arrived home without a technical delay. I've quoted this section of the ruling back to KLM/Delta in our email communications and they're basically just ignoring me and responding back saying we are only owed 50% of the compensation without even addressing the court ruling at all.

How can I further pursue this? Usually, I'd let it go because it wasn't a huge inconvenience overall, but honestly, at this point, I'm annoyed enough to take the time to make it happen.

I don't want to use one of the companies that pursue claims like this (airhelp, etc) if I can avoid it, as they take a decent cut.

"Deciding whether to revisit Berlin, or to visit Dresden, or to visit Leipzig as my final destination on my Central Europe trip next year?",2,znb9wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/znb9wx/deciding_whether_to_revisit_berlin_or_to_visit/,3,1671185296.0,"I’m planning a trip through Europe next year around April/May time. 

So far the trip is:

Belgrade (3 nights)
Budapest (4 nights)
Bratislava (1 night)
Vienna (3 nights)
Prague (3 nights)
.... (2 nights remaining)

The two nights remaining could either be:

(A) Berlin (2 nights)
But I HAVE visited Berlin before a couple years back. I did enjoy Berlin at the time, but I do feel perhaps it was a little “too cool” for me. I feel like I’ve visited all of the main attractions I wanted to see. I feel like the only reason for me to revisit would be to go visit the techno clubs, since I didn’t go to the last time. There’s no other reason massively drawing me back to Berlin, other than the parties/clubs and the cheap flight back home.

(B) 1 Night in Dresden + 1 night in Berlin. 
This option gives me the chance to check out Dresden - which looks like such a beautiful city. And the recent history of the city does interest me. Although I do like pretty / interesting archtecture, I’m not sure whether Dresden is worth the overnight stay. It does look small, so maybe a day trip from Prague is a better idea(?) 

(C) 1 Night in Leipzig + 1 night in Berlin. 
I hear that Leipzig is “the new Berlin”. So it could be a cool idea to visit Leipzig. I heard it’s a cool student city with good nightlife. Doesn’t appear as pretty as Dresden, but perhaps it is a more vibrant city. I do like vibrant cities.

(D) 1 night in Dresden + 1 night in Leipzig. 
I can get a flight back home from Leipzig (although more expensive than the Berlin flight). And this option gives me the chance to visit two new cities. But then again I miss out on revisiting Berlin.

Which option do you guys think is best for me?

My Interests: food, a buzz/vibrancy in the city, good nightlife, nice architecture, interesting recent history, good beer.",2022-12-16 12:08:16

My fiance and I are going to go on a RTW beginning February 1. We are starting off in Mexico, then working our way down to Brazil for the Carnival and then heading to Lebanon for a wedding in July.

We will be travelling until May 2024.

My original intention was to play it by ear, but I am starting to feel a little scared that maybe we should plan a bit more our itnerary. 

For those who did a RTW, did you plan all your destinations before? Or did you go with the flow?

I was intending that we move from destination to destination. For example, if we feel like a beach we would find cheap tickets or buses to the destination. 

We also would love to spend 3 weeks to a month in a city and do day trips on the weekend since my fiance will be remote working. 

We are both burned out in a way so we also don't want to move alot.

Also, another problem: when I tried to apply for a state ID today, I found out that my current home address is written differently on several official documents. Each one has a variation of the same apartment number. So let's say my address is ""1234 Apple St Apt 1A."" Some documents have it as ""1234 Apple St Apt A"" and others have it as ""1234 A Apple St."" I couldn't proceed with the application process because the addresses on my parent's documents didn't match the one I wrote down; however, my main concern now is that I won't be able to get home if I don't report my current home address correctly.

My parents plan to bring a bunch of documents to prove that our address is written down differently a lot.

Our biggest priority is doing some low to moderate intensity day hikes in the Dolomites and also just getting to experience life in Northern Italy—none of us has been there before. 

We would like to spend a few days doing day hikes, maybe a few intermittent days of relaxing, and a few days of city life and going to museums. Generally we prefer depth over breadth. Not sure about:

1. Which cities to prioritize?
2. How many cities is too ambitious? Is there a set of cities that pair well with also being able to hike the Dolomites?
3. Is it better to have a “home base” and then commute out to a few cities with a rental car or to jump between hotels and use public transit? If there is a home base, which city would you recommend?
4. Any experiences using rental cars, ride share, or AirBNB in Northern Italy? Curious to hear your experiences.

Is 2 Days - 1 Night from Marrakech-Merzouga-Fes too rushed?,2,zmyjet,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zmyjet/is_2_days_1_night_from_marrakechmerzougafes_too/,3,1671143985.0,"***Slightly long post, but the summary questions are at the bottom!***

I'll be flying into Marrakech with my fiancee one Saturday evening in January, and flying out of Tangier the following Sunday (so 8 days in total).

Our main concern is that the 2 Day-1 Night Transport Tour from Marrakech to Fes, whilst fairly efficient travel-wise (as we'd be ""using"" a day anyway if we got the 7-8 hour train from Marrakech to Fes, but this way we at least get a desert visit in), might be too rushed and/or too long in the car/minivan??

Our draft itinerary looks like:

* Saturday: arrive late night into Marrakech
* Sunday: Marrakech
* Monday: Marrakech
* Tuesday: depart 7am on organised tour to Merzouga, stay overnight in desert
* Wednesday: depart Merzouga early morning with tour to get into Fes early evening
* Thursday: Fes
* Friday: Fes
* Saturday: depart Fes early morning to Chefchaouen 
* Sunday: depart Chefchaouen in the afternoon to get to Tangier to fly home that evening

So, I guess our questions are:

1. Are we better off doing the 3 Day-2 Night Marrakech>Merzouga>Fes tour? If the answer is yes, then are we better off 'taking' a day away from our 2 days in Marrakech or in Fes?
2. What's the transport like on the journey itself? And are there frequent stops?
3. Anything else glaringly wrong with this itinerary?

I’m not positive what to make of this situation. My wife are on a trip to one of the top hotels in Costa Rica (will leave out identifying details unless someone feels it’s relevant).  We just got back from the pool and noticed that our room was propped open. We immediately notified security who is pulling camera and door scans, and we’ve checked all of our belongings. 

I’m unsure as to what might’ve happened. We absolutely had house keeping come around 9am and we’re in the room ourselves around 11. We’ve had turndown service around 6-7pm nightly, so I don’t believe it was that. 

With this being a relatively nice and expensive hotel, is it unrealistic to request a different room? Our privacy is now a concern for the final two nights of our trip. 

Any ideas or advised steps are appreciated. This is likely paranoia but perspectives are welcomed.

Edit: 
First, thank you to everyone that offered some helpful perspective. Specifically folks with experience in hospitality. I appreciate the validation of some of my initial concern. After a thorough look through of our items and the room nothing was out of place or irregular. 
We got some follow up from the hotel cameras and access reports. It seems that there was spot service that day from their room service team (separate from their housekeeping team) checking our mini bar and food supply. Some folks were missing one of the points I probably didn’t convey well enough, there was no clarification on how long our room was left open with the latch. My best guess was 1-4hours. 
The hotel did offer complimentary dinner as an apology which was a very nice gesture given it was a mistake. I plan to talk to the manager on duty before leaving tomorrow. 
Thanks again all!",2022-12-16 00:21:19

I was fortunate enough to snag incredibly cheap premium cabin flights landing in Munich and exiting from London Heathrow next week. However, I got them super last minute yesterday and I need to fill in an itinerary for 2. While this purchase was definitely made with my aviation geek brain, I do want to enjoy my time in Europe.

My partner and myself are primarily interested in the cuisine, be it fine dining or street food.  After that, it would be experiences to see historic sites, or enjoy the landscape.

I've never been to Europe before so this is some last minute research, staying up all night scouring this subreddit, youtube, google, etc.. I'd appreciate any help and suggestions! I'll update this post as I figure things out.

12/20 - Land in Munich at Noon.

12/21, 12/22, - Hofbrauhaus, Marienplatz, BMW tour. Attempting to get to Neuschwanstein Castle or Dachau.

Redacted:  ~~I really want to see a Christmas market, but there isn't much in Munich that attracts me. The Christmas Market in Frankfurt is definitely on the bucket list though. Debating on whether to get a hotel/hostel here and enjoying the City for at least one day, or going straight to Frankfurt. In a recent post, I read that Munich isn't really a multi-day city.~~

12/23 - Train to Cologne -> Hopefully catch the tail-end of the markets before they close down

12/24 - Cologne and take the train to Brussels -> London

12/25 - Christmas in London!

12/26 - Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, London Eye, Trafalgar Square, Tower of London

12/27 - Cambridge, Oxford, Brighton, or Salisbury & StoneHenge Tour? Anyone have recommendations/preferences here?

12/28 - Pray we can wake up at ~~5am~~ 3AM(?) to make it to Heathrow for a 9am flight

I'd also love some recommendations for things to do in each respective city beyond the usual tourist sites!

Edit 1: Debating staying for a day or 2. This would push Frankfurt for 12/22, 12/23.

Edit 2: Amsterdam/Paris seem way too rushed. Would rather do 5 days in Germany, 3 days in London. With the phenomenal feedback, we'll stay in Munich until 12/23 and head to Frankfurt then just to catch the bucketlist Christmas Market. 12/24 in Cologne, 12/25 morning figure out how we're getting to London

Edit 3: Definitely have to take into consideration the strikes in UK... Praying we can get onto our plane getting home!  


Edit 4: Market schedule reconsidered, cutting Frankfurt out altogether. Hopefully train travel through Brussels into London won't be impacted too heavily. ",2022-12-16 00:15:12

We are a couple in the early 30s from Austria, so this time of the year can be quite cold why we want to fly somewhere warmer. Usually we do like to travel by car within the country and not by domestic plane (if possible). What we normally look for is to do something not too touristic like resorts, lots of beach days or guided tours only. We focus more on light hiking (day hikes not trekking), cities, culinary and nature. Also we like to keep our it itinerary within the destination flexible. Like being in one place one day longer or change the itinerary based on weather. So being able to accommodations short-term. This time it would also be cool to have 1 or 2 afternoons on beaches if it is warm. Also budget is not really a big factor on our side.

Some trips we loved in the past: Georgia (country), Scotland, Andalusia, Portugal

&#x200B;

Places we currently have a look at include:

&#x200B;

Colombia - Looks amazing, however it is a huge country so domestic flights are mandatory i guess

Vietnam - We are really interested in the northern part and would have been our first choice. However, it looks like this time of the year is not the best for this area (e.g. for Sapa)

Thailand - Northern Part as well here combined with maybe Laos and a few days in the south for some beach feeling (domestic flight as well). Also more touristic maybe?

Costa Rica - Looks also amazing, however we are not sure if it might be a little bit too touristic for our taste. Also more expensive, than the other destinations.

Guatemala - Somewhat hard to get to from Austria unfortunately, however combining with Belize seems to be quite interesting

&#x200B;

We are open to other suggestions too - for example countries in Africa. However, I have absolutely no idea in any country in Africa (unfortunately). Also maybe I am a bit too put off by countries being too touristic or the domestic flights.

Cairo December 2022- What an experience!,26,zmnh6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zmnh6k/cairo_december_2022_what_an_experience/,6,1671117247.0,"I felt compelled to share my experience because when I was planning my trip, there was so much mixed information- although I think this post will only contribute to that. So just a quick backstory- I'm a solo female traveler, mid-30s from Chicago. I'm a pretty well seasoned traveler- I've been a few dozen countries including Morocco (solo and great experience) and Turkey (with another girlfriend and another great experience). I only say this as just a little background on my own experience and that it won't be everyone else's experience. I also say this as a woman with dark features- my blonde girlfriends have had different experiences traveling. I also need to stop saying ""experience"" so much haha.

Cairo is INTENSE! I wasn't bothered my being scammed or harassed, honestly the worst part was the insanity of the traffic. Like, I was hesitant to do the normal amount of exploring I do because there didn't seem to be any discernible traffic laws and everyone just walks out into the street into traffic to cross. It was just a lot. Honestly, the scammers weren't nearly as bad as in maybe even Spain. I will say, I tried to pre-order an Uber to go go the airport to come home and had two drivers cancel on me so I grabbed a taxi. The driver tried to say 1300 Egyptian pounds (which is INSANE, thats like $60) and I was like um no, I'll give you 200. We settled on 250 which was reasonable. You just have to be confident to know when you need to speak up and haggle. I told him, I am a stupid American but I'm not that stupid- and we both laughed. The pollution is wild in Cairo, too. These were the two things that stood out to me the most and I feel like weren't as frequently mentioned in the other overviews I had read both on here and just online in general. Aside from constantly being worried I was going to be hit my a car (whether in a car or on foot) I genuinely felt very safe. I took the subway from the city center to Coptic Cairo- and was surprised to see a woman's only car! It's not mandatory but honestly I loved it and I wish Chicago would do this, maybe that's a hot take? But the subway was clean and efficient. 

Anyway- I hired a guide from Viator for my day at the pyramids, the bazaar, the museum, and he was great. I felt safe and learned a lot. Riding a camel is very fucking scary lol (but my camel was very sweet, I'm just a little bitch). Like I said above, I ventured to Coptic Cairo to walk around. I got there early in the morning and just sort of explored the religious complex- very cool! Also a great way to get out into the city a bit. I also walked around Zamalek. I did a food tour my last night (look up Food Tours with Mila) and she took us to Al Omal City which is a very local neighborhood on the west side of the Nile- I'm actually not sure if it was Giza or Cairo but only about 15 mins from my hotel which was right by Tahrir Square. Was in a group of about 4 of us (another solo traveler and a couple) and had a great time. The food was delicious (apparently pigeon tastes like turkey) and Mila was really delightful (and we love supporting a woman owned business!). 

Overall, I had a great time and am glad I went. With that said, probably the average American tourist would be really overwhelmed (again, not tooting my own horn, I've just been to several non-western countries before- and Cairo made Istanbul feel like child's play lol). But I also felt safe and this was just such an amazing trip I will always remember. Living in Chicago I am CONSTANTLY complaining about Chicago drivers (and still will haha) but have a new appreciation for our traffic laws and street lights and crosswalks. Oh yeah, I flew Royal Jordanian. Chicago to Amman to Cairo and reverse on the way back (obviously). It was fine- food was fine, flights were smooth, no delays, no issues with check-ins or transfers at all. Amman has a VERY nice airport! Honestly, the Cairo airport was nice too. I flew out of Terminal 2 and it was modern and clean. LaGuardia before the renovation was a million times worse. Anyway, that's just my two cents. Glad I went and am also glad to be home.",2022-12-15 17:14:07

Positive Egypt experience,22,zmfq7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zmfq7n/positive_egypt_experience/,7,1671091339.0,"I have just returned from a trip to Egypt and I had a wonderful time. I haven't posted much on this reddit, but felt the need to share the positive experience I had in Egypt. The reason is that I almost did not go because of the many negative experiences that I found here, especially about the vendors and I felt it was needed to provide a different view.

TL;DR: Vendor and taxi touts are there when visiting the tourist sites (especially around the entrance) but when you ignore them/their shops (we never buy something at such stands) and you stay in some quieter areas (e.g. Zamalek, West Bank, Elephantine Island) our experience was that Egypt is definitely better than for example Cuba, India, Peru, Bangkok or Morocco (last two were the worst we experienced).

Just as background, my wife and I are 35 years old from Western Europe and have travelled to some 15 countries in mainly Asia and Latin America in the last 10 years.

We spent time in cairo, giza, luxor, aswan and safaga. In all honesty, the time I was most annoyed was in the all-inclusive hotel in safaga when on the beach every 10 minutes someone from the hotel's salesteam/animation team came around to ask to participate in an activity, massage, spa treatment, excursion, etc.

In Cairo we stayed in the Zamalek area (the island) which I understood to be an international/ambassy district. Whenever we walk on the streets there, we were never approached for anything it was a very nice neighbourhood; also because it was quite green compared to the other parts of cairo. We had an egyption sim and mainly used Uber to travel around; worked like a charm. When entering the Egyption Museum we were approach by a guy who offered himself as guide but he moved on directly as we declined. Also occasionally when walking on the streets a taxi drove slowly to offer services, but all directly left upon when we said no/ignored them.

In Luxor we stayed at the West Bank and it was a very nice and calm area as well. Whenever we walked on the streets there, we were never approached by anyone. Similar for Aswan (we stayed at Elephantine island). Only when we crossed the water by ferry, at the ferry terminal we were always offered taxis but I guess that makes sense.

Around the larger tourist sites such as Giza, Valley of Kings, Karnak, Abu Simbel, etc there are many shops. We never buy at such shops anyway so we don't go into the shops/look at their stuff. At every site I believe someone asked to come visit their shop, but we thanked them and that was it. Vendors also sometime stood in our walking path to show their salesware but we just sidesteps and walked on. Also the guards in Gizah/King's Valley were all fine, they just sticked to their job of checking your ticket. On advise of our guide (who is not allowed in tombs/pyramids) we did tip on guard so that he showed as some hidden features in a tomb that we otherwise would not have seen (totally worth it!); the brilliance of these people 3000 years ago was astonishing.

When I compare Egypt it is probably most close to Mexico in terms of street vendor/taxi approaches. Itn our experience it was definitely better than for example Cuba, India, Peru, Bangkok and Morocco.

When you offset this  against what the country has to offer in terms of history and the beauty of reliefs, temples, pyramids (and then you realize these are 3000-4000 years old!) and in terms of food (although admittedly the Libanese restaurant we tried in Cairo made us want to visit Libanon next) visiting is a no-brainer.",2022-12-15 10:02:19

- not a party city, just not our thing plus we don't really drink

- we're open to both big city/metropolitan areas and destinations all about nature, we just don't want to have to hike to get to the views. also swimming is always a plus

- safe for two young women traveling alone

- budget is USD $1500 ish. for reference we usually stay in marriot hotels and fly spirit when traveling domestically 

- some things we like: history, art, beaches, live music/plays, nerdy stuff

- some things we're not into: shopping/places solely to spend money, long lines and crowded places, main attraction being alcohol

- places we don't want to go because we've either already been or are planning to go another time: Florida, Mexico, Salem MA, NYC, Portland OR, Seattle WA, San Francisco, Washington DC.

Day 1-4: Johannesburg

\- Arrive and get settled, then visit Apartheid Museum, Constitution Hill, Pieterson Museum, Cradle of Humankind

Day 4-6: Durban

\- Hoping to drive down to Durban and visit the Kranzkloof Nature Reserve, maybe the marine world; any additional things to do here appreciated.

Day 6-8: Hogsback

\- Big Lord of the Rings fan so planning to drive onwards to Hogsback to visit Away with the Fairies, the waterfall, forest, etc. 

Day 8-10: Plattenburg Bay

\- Robberg Nature Reserve, Snorkeling with the Seals (is this inadvisable in June because of the weather?) 

Day 10-14: Cape Town

\- Robben Island, Table Mountain, Boulders Beach, Chapman's Peak Drive

**Safety**: Aside from the usual precautions, is there anything that we should know about any of the above destinations? We're both mid-20s guys (of Indian descent), if that matters.

**Road Trip**: Any routes/roads to avoid or any things we must see along the way?

Citymapper is showing me a 52 minute ride by taking the N17. From what I've gathered, that's a night bus. But I've set my options at 5pm.   


On another website, it says 18 minutes via train. 

But when I looked at the actual TMB website, no journey to be found.

Exactly what should I be using in Barcelona when figuring out transit? Google? Citymapper?

My wife and I have 9-10 days off in February. We’re looking to book a last minute trip in the next week or two. 

We’d like to do something more adventurous than luxurious. Not really worried about budget. We live in the US.

Some initial thoughts were the following

- Trekking to Machu Picchu 
- Backpacking in Patagonia 
- Going to Vietnam and exploring 

Open to basically any other suggestions you all have. Only places off of the list would be Western Europe, Japan, Mexico, Guatemala as we’ve been there recently.

Orbitz Price Guarantee is a scam,4,zm50nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zm50nj/orbitz_price_guarantee_is_a_scam/,25,1671058805.0,"Made the mistake of using Orbitz to book a flight on Monday.  The very next day I checked the same flight - exact same itinerary and flight numbers - and the cost had decreased by $140.

I remember reading something about a price guarantee and found this link: https://www.orbitz.com/p/info-other/guarantees

It says ""Thanks to the Orbitz Price Guarantee, you can book with confidence, knowing that if you find your flight, car rental, cruise or activity cheaper on our site or another site within 24 hours, we'll refund you the difference.""

Within the 24 hours I tried to fill out the form and there is a bug where the field for the new, lower price would not accept the input.  I tried different browsers, computers, incognito, different formats of the number, etc. and there is simply a bug in the form - it is broken.

I then chatted with someone online to get a refund of the difference.  For an hour this chat went on as I tried to politely explain to the person the situation.  They could not help me.

Today, I've called 4 representatives (sounds like they are in Latin America) and each told me a different thing.  One told me that I have to ""buy"" the price guarantee when I pay for the flight.  Another told me if the form didn't work there was nothing they could do.  Another put me on hold for 30 minutes (gave up).  The last person put me on hold and then the call disconnected.

The Orbitz price guarantee is clear.  My itinerary is exactly the same as the cheaper one saw yesterday and still see today. 

I can't believe I've wasted so much time on this.  What is wrong with companies and the world these days?  Is it late stage capitalism?  Companies lie to us, make us speak with overseas representatives who cannot or will not help.  If I were in a banana republic this would make sense.  But I paid $1300 to a USA-based company and they are unable to help me and their guarantee is a load of crap.  At this point, I am just giving up.  $140 would have bought me and my gal a nice dinner but the frustration, stress, and time suck is not worth it.  Will never use Orbitz or any of their sister companies again.",2022-12-15 01:00:05

Dolomites road trip in winter,1,zm3y4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zm3y4v/dolomites_road_trip_in_winter/,0,1671056161.0,"Hello everybody,
i’m looking for suggestions and advice considering a road trip I want to do to northern Italy this winter. I have a week of spare time after Christmas, an insulated van (no heater though) and as I live close to Vienna the Dolomites are just about a 5-6 hours drive away from my home.

I’m confident to drive in the mountains and recently ordered a -20°C (-6°F) rated sleeping bag as I’m planning to sleep in my car on this trip. I already have a 7cm thick mattress and some blankets in the car and they worked great during spring/summer trips but for a winter trip I had to step up the game. I know, temperature sensitivity is very subjective but do you think this will be enough to stay comfortable during the night?

Mainly I want to do some easy/moderate hikes and landscape photography but as I‘m no professional alpinist safety is my highest priority. I‘ve researched some locations already and would like to hear some of your opinions or experiences about them:

Lago di Braies

Have been there during summer, easily accessible, nice hike around the lake and great photo location. Seems to be pretty safe to do the hike in winter too. 

Tre Cime Loop / Cadini di Misurina Viewpoint

Would have loved to go there but seems too dangerous in winter and not very accessible as the toll road is currently closed. Maybe any alternative to get a nice view on the Tre Cime?

Alp di Siusi

Nice plateu with a great view. Pretty safe I guess as there are residential buildings and hotels around and I would love to stay a night there to catch the sunrise over the valley in the morning. 

Cinque Torri Hike

How about this one? I was thinking about going up with the cable car, do a loop and hike down the 425 trail back to the cable car station. Unfortunately I haven‘t found any info if this is also possible in the winter season.

Gola di Fanes

Beautiful waterfalls along a very accessible trail. This is gonne be no problem I guess. 

San Giovanni

There are definitely moments when I have thought, I wish my partner was here to experience this! But overall I’ve really enjoyed this trip. It’s not a country they wanted to visit so I don’t really have pangs of missing them.

My SO and I will be driving from Portland to Phoenix in 8 days. I haven't booked overnight accommodation yet because I wanted to be flexible in case of weather. My biggest concern is running into poor weather conditions. 

One possible route is I-5 down to LA and then I-10. The biggest concern here in the mountain pass over the California / Oregon border. We would likely stay in Ashland, OR on 12/22 and then drive down to LA on 12/23 which means we would be going over Siskiyou Summit in the early morning. I'm looking at forecasts for Ashland and it seems like it'll be well above freezing around that time. I can't seem to find anything for Siskiyou Summit this far out in advance.

The other option is  through southeastern Oregon / central Nevada into Las Vegas. As far as I know, there aren't any mountain passes on this route though it is mostly high elevation and very remote two lane roads which I don't like. We would probably stay in Burns, OR on 12/22 and then drive to Vegas on 12/23.

Which option do you think is better?

Thanks in advance!

Japan travel with criminal conviction in Australia

Hi all, first time posting on here.(bit of background) I live in Australia and have a New Zealand Passport.
My partner and I are getting married next year in April and have booked travel to Tokyo next year in August.
I was convicted of a minor dr** possession charge in Australia in 2015 which is on my criminal record. I have seen things about just ticking ‘NO’ on the incoming entry card when going over on the 90 day visa free travel and just not declaring anything to do with my record.

The things I was wondering, I will be changing my name through marriage after my wedding, I have a conviction in Australia but have a New Zealand Passport. 

Will any of this help possibly deter me being turned back at the border?

Any advice from fellow Australians or Kiwis will be much appreciated or just anyone who has been in this situation!

- hot air balloons aren't always available and can cancel at any given time without refund

Any dangerous places to watch out for? Are the trains dangerous to ride during the night (11PM and onwards?)? Asking because my flight back is at 6 in the morning so I would like to avoid any dangerous situations and because trains are super dangerous here where I live.

So I’ve been planning to go over to Europe from April-September 2023 but have just found out about this 90/180 Day Schengen Rule.
I’ve had a deeper look and found that I can do a Bilateral Visa Waiver which would give me an extra 90 days but I would have to stay in that country for the total 90 days and if I’m correct it would not effect my 90/180 Schengen Days.

Initially I’m going to be flying over by myself so this is how I’ve mapped out my travel 

April, May, June - Bilateral Visa Waiver in one of the 3 countries (Portugal, Spain or Italy)

July, August, September - Use all 90/180 of my Schengen Days traveling other countries with friends that are coming over.

While I’m on my Bilateral Visa Waiver I don’t want to be in the same town/city for the whole 3 months and still want to move around, roughly about 10 days per city/town give or take a day or 2.
Preferably somewhere that’s going to be warmest that time of year, cheap and also have a diversity on places to see and experience.

Avoid most dangerous roads in Africa,5,zlrpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zlrpeg/avoid_most_dangerous_roads_in_africa/,7,1671026463.0,"Hi fellow travelers, 

In January I'm gonna start my trip through Africa (starting in Morocco, following the west-coast to South-Africa) for 14 months in my Landrover Defender.

While it will obviously not be possible to be completely safe in terms of choosing the least dangerous roads, certain countries are especially dangerous when it comes to kidnapping foreigners. So I was wondering, if you have any tips or resources how to plan your trip in dangerous countries? Just using GoogleMaps would be a Roulette game, since usual Map Providers do not really care about the crime rate at certain roads. I've heard several stories from tourists traveling through Namibia and were lucky enough to be warned about certain roads by locals. From your experience: Is talking to locals generally the best approach, or do you know any other resources to be used?

I (M24) am planning my first solo travel trip to Europe. I will be going from last week of December to the second week of February. I realize that this is not the most fortunate time, but it was about the only time that I could make this necessary trip happen. 

While there, I aim to keep my budget <$8k. I am looking to go to museums, eat, drink, and party to live music with people I meet in hostels. 

My current itinerary includes: 

Lisbon>Madrid>Barcelona from December 25 to approx. Jan. 12. I will be in company of friends for the first two destinations and accommodations have already been made. I will have a Eurail Global Pass that is valid from Jan. 5 to Jan. 19. 

I will fly out of Amsterdam February 7, and would love to spend a few days there. I realize that my arrival and departure locations are not the easiest to fill between. 

I have an idea in mind of a route that I want to take, but I am worried that I have the completely wrong idea. I am also slightly worried that the weather will try to get me down.

I am planning on embracing the winter and finding snow. Snow is good. However, I am not opposed to completely changing my projected route for the best overall experience. 

Currently, I would love to/am debating going to Venice (2d) >Ljubljana (3d) >Budapest>Vienna>Prague>Berlin>Amsterdam. 

Venice and Ljubljana have always been a dream of mine, but dreams can wait.

- you cannot rebook as the flight was already done
- send links where I can download an invoice, even though I never asked for it

Also, I am not sure what a realistic budget would be but I expect 10k for 1.5 months should be enough since I usually stay at cheaper AirBnBs. I am not too much into historic places or architecture. More into unusual things/places and food. 

Which cities near the coast are a ""must-see"" when visiting the US for the first time? 

I am also grateful for any other tips I should know.",2022-12-13 22:26:43

Unfortunately, I’m having a bit of a mental dilemma involving travelling and work. As the title states, I’m currently working in a position that I only applied for to fund a 2 and a half month trip to Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam with one of my best friends. 

I worked as a temp at my workplace over the summer, and then earlier this month I was offered the opportunity to extend my contract until June (travelling from the beginning of May). This job has no relation to my future goals, and I only work part time to freelance and work on my true passion which my workplace are really supportive of. I honestly thought me leaving a month early wouldn’t be an issue as they know that progressing in this job isn’t an aspiration of mine. 

Unfortunately today, my boss brought up the fact that the main reason I am employed is to help out with a crazy workload at the end of May/early June and I feel so guilty about it. I don’t particularly like the role but I really like my colleagues and they do so much work for crappy pay. I hate the thought of just leaving them randomly with immense amounts of work, but also if I tell them that I’m leaving in May, I could get fired and have no money for my trip. 

I’m thinking about telling my bosses at the end of Feb before putting in a month’s notice but honestly, I feel so guilty. I need this trip, I went through a traumatic breakup earlier this year, I just graduated, I’m young and want to do something adventurous. My flights are also already booked lmaooo so I’m just looking for some advice to better deal with this feeling.

However - in 2023, I'll be away for much longer periods, like several months at a time, which will require some heavier warmer clothes. I'm also going to want space to take away some ayurvedic herbs, souvenirs, etc. from India.

It has always been a challenge to fit everything in my 21"" TUMI, especially because I'm a meditation teacher and travel with a brass puja kit and teaching supplies that cannot be sourced locally. 

I am growing weary of the ""packing game"" and considering just buying a checked luggage which I would equip with an AirTag for tracking and a protective cover. 

I'm considering the Briggs & Riley Baseline Spinner Large, because the XL size is 68.5"" total dimensions, and my preferred airline American's oversize limit is 62"". 

I'm a OneWorld ruby member, so free checked bags, but that won't help with oversize limits.

&#x200B;

QUESTION 1:  In your experience, how strict are airlines (specifically American) about the oversize dimensions? Do you think I should go for the 68"" dimensions and hope nobody notices? I definitely don't want to spend $1000 on a bag if I'm going to have to spend $100 to check it every time. 

QUESTION 2: Does anyone have any better recommendations than the B&R Baseline series if I am willing to spend around $900?

Italy Trip // Planning Help,1,zl1yye,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zl1yye/italy_trip_planning_help/,12,1670953879.0,"Hi All!

My husband and I are looking to do a trip to Italy this May/June. We have blocked 2 weeks. We are 30 and this will be our first large trip away from our toddler. Looking to relax, drink wine, and eat pasta.

When I went to plan I got a little overwhelmed with how many options of amazing places there we to choose from. Looking for some help in narrowing down where we should go. 

Here are some high level criteria:

-	We are not interested in visiting large cities and would prefer smaller villages, wine regions, countryside, quieter areas. Specifically want to avoid Rome - I have been before and was not a fan
-	We definitely want to visit some cool wineries and spend time in wine regions 
-	we plan to rent a car and are ok with bopping around a fair amount
-	my husband wants to visit the Ferrari factory 
-	we have Lake Como and Dolomites on our lists but realize these are fairly far - wondering if it’s worth it to try to incorporate into our trip?
-	we prefer staying at small boutique hotels or bed and breakfasts - ideally the more private the better
-	an ideal day would be waking up slow, hanging out by the pool where we are staying, wandering into town for some lunch, exploring a bit, hanging at our spot, then wine and dinner 


Appreciate any advice. There are so many wine regions! Which have the most going on? So we can spend time hopping around? I worth hitting the coast? Or is all inland the move?

Appreciate any and all advice!!

Travel companion advice,3,zl2fpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zl2fpu/travel_companion_advice/,38,1670954914.0,"So, long story short, me and a friend are travelling this weekend to the neighbouring city by ferry. She reveals to me on day 2 she's going to meet a guy, without even telling me while we were planning this. So now on day 2 for half the day I'm alone. On night 2 she wants me to go to this club, which I agreed to without really wanting to for her sake, but then when I ask her to book tickets for another event we both agreed on, she said she's changed her mind and basically says no (despite me saying I really wanted to do it.)

She then shows me the conversation with this guy she's meeting and he kept asking to see a photo fo me, because he wants to hear my accent (I'm from abroad staying in the country with my friend.) I made it clear I wasn't going to meet him, and didn't want him to have my photo.

The girl asks if I'll be okay on my own while she's on her date and I agree, though the whole idea was to travel and explore the city together so obviously I'm not okay, I'm just lying. My issue is, when I'm exploring alone, I really don't want to bump into them two on their date, or return to my hotel room with her to find them doing something (as she suggested may happen) with all my belongings there...

I am uncomfortable with the situation but I do want to go explore the city and travelling with this ""friend"" is safer and easier for me than going alone. So I'm definitely going to go. I just need advice on how to set my boundaries please. Thanks everyone

Portugal for a week—is Coimbra worth it?,0,zl1z31,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zl1z31/portugal_for_a_weekis_coimbra_worth_it/,11,1670953887.0,"I am solo traveling for the first time to Portugal for a week in January on this itinerary:

- Sunday (Day 0): Depart (overnight flight)
- Monday (1): Arrive in the afternoon to Lisbon, stay overnight to get acclimated
- Tuesday (2): Morning train to Coimbra, spend the day there and take an evening train to Porto
- Tuesday night to Friday (2-5): Stay in Porto
- Friday to Tuesday (5-9): take early morning train back to Lisbon, stay there. Potentially do trip to Sintra on Monday.
- Tuesday (9): Depart Lisbon (early morning flight)

What are people’s thoughts on Coimbra? Is just a day trip enough to Coimbra or is it worth staying 1 night there? Is there a different city that’d be better to visit in its place? Or would it be better to not stop at all & go straight to Porto, and instead add an extra day in Lisbon to do a Sintra day trip? 

Would love any opinions. I don’t want to feel rushed or pack too much in since I only have a week, but I also want to make sure I’m not missing anything really worthwhile. I’m pretty open to anything but mostly going places with good nightlife would be ideal.

New Orleans Suggestions insight needed,0,zkyo79,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zkyo79/new_orleans_suggestions_insight_needed/,5,1670945977.0,"So me and my wife are going to New Orleans for the holidays. Mid December. 

A number of things.

1. We are both occult heavy people, and plan on doing the cemetery no 1 tour ""as we apparently cant just walk through."" As well as the museum of death. We would appreciate things such as these.

2. I'd love to go to a chill jazz/cigar lounge that's not too crowded. Aka nowhere near Bourbon st. Somewhere comfortable and not rowdy. I'm not much of a ""party"" person but love the idea of easy going adult spots to hang out at. Mainly I don't wanna get puked on cause I'll be dressed up somewhat in some formal/occult ware.

3. We already understand stuff about hecklers, scammers ""bet $10 I know where you got dem shoes.""

4. We are from south Ga and from videos we watched a lot of food is VERY similar to our southern/swamp food. BUT I would love a decent low country boil. Most if the stuff I get here tend to be very lackluster. We have crawfish, oysters, shrimp, ect. The Savannah area in GA is pretty similar in food diversity, but from what I've seen lacks the spice diversity in New Orleans. I'd actually suggest going to Savannah and taking some tours there for people coming to Ga.

5. We will definitely be going to the main streets. Bourbon, Frenchmen, Royal, ect. Looking for some off-main areas to go. 

6. I'm pretty good with my French ""I know creole is different but I should be able to get a few things"" so if ya got some hard to find french/creole speaking places I'd love the challenge.",2022-12-13 17:39:37
First time traveling to Europe (Madrid and Barcelona).

I'm going to Europe with my friend for the first time at the end of the month. We'll be in Madrid and Barcelona for 9 days. The only other country I've been to is Mexico so I'm a bit nervous and anxious.

What are some tips and ideas (positive and negative) you can provide me for Madrid and Barcelona? Recommendations on restaurants, bars, sight-seeing activities?

Can I use my Visa debit card in Spain or should I get Euros? Should I call my debit and credit card companies to let them know I'll be overseas? Is it too much of a hassle to bring US cash with me?

I have a layover in London Heathrow to and from. Being that it's a long flight and a change in time zones, how can I minimize my chances of being completely jet lagged?

Is it just me or is booking a hotel becoming a downright hassle?,0,zkxq69,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zkxq69/is_it_just_me_or_is_booking_a_hotel_becoming_a/,76,1670943414.0,"Don’t mind me I’m just here to vent.

I’m planning a weekend getaway to Madrid. Plans made and flights purchased, all that’s left to do is book a hotel. It’s been 3 days of research, I still haven’t got a place to stay, and to top it all off I’m becoming angrier by the minute. So here’s my journey so far:

I go on booking.com and start my search. There are 1657 available properties. Since I’m well past my hostel bunking days, I’m looking for a nice double bed with a private bathroom. Great, so far my search has been narrowed down to 1226 properties. I already stay in an apartment, so I want an actual hotel so I could feel more like I’m on holiday than just at a different home. Incredibly, this filters it down to just 280 properties.

Should I filter out by star rating or not? I mean I’ve stayed at beautiful 3-star hotels and run-down 4-star hotels. Can I afford a 5-star? I’ll go for all just in case there’s a 3-star gem or a good discount on a 5-star. 256. There’s still 256 hotels left to choose from.

Even if narrow it down to a central location - there’s still over 100 properties to look at. Of course I only checked out the first few pages, but I think I managed to pick out 9 contenders. It’s only been 3 or so hours of my life, but who’s counting at this point.

Now I’m going to go and read reviews, critically evaluate them (eliminate potential entitled Karen reviews as well as the ones from i’m just happy to be here guy), compare amenities, and of course the prices. The hotel I’m currently looking at costs 490€ (3 nights, full stay) on booking.com, 430€ on Orbitz, but we have a winner with Agoda, selling the room for 401€. And I’m yet to check a bunch of other websites for their prices.

So far I’ve thoroughly checked one of the hotels from my list, and after almost 2 hours I’ve abandoned my research to come vent here. I mean it’s great having all these options catering to different kinds of travellers, but is it getting to be too much? If I keep up this research I’ll end up spending more time planning my holiday than actually being on it.

How do you people do it? Do you have a system? Any quick painless ways to choose and book a hotel? Help a frustrated traveller out, please.",2022-12-13 16:56:54

Do not use Indie Campers!!,1,zkwyeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zkwyeq/do_not_use_indie_campers/,3,1670941390.0,"I thought I would just share our horror story of a trip with this group to prevent people from going through what we have experienced with Indie Campers.

We were on our Honeymoon in Florida and hired and RV from indie campers to travel the Florida Keys (Highly recommend Florida keys). When we hired it with them all the marketing on their website suggested to take out the premium protection insurance and reduce your ""maximum"" liability to $200. This is entirely false marketing to lure you in and written in the fine print of the contract there is a huge list of exceptions to the ""maximum"" liability, the roof, below the wheels, engine, the inside, damage whilst not driving, damage by wildlife, break-in... You name it, it's probably excluded. Therefore you have an uncapped liability for their campervan on your trip! 

We got charged $5.4k for a dent to the roof 2 weeks after our rental, no communication from indie campers on it, they just took it straight from my credit card. I would like to say we're a one off but they do this daily to people. 

Any advice is welcome, were currently in contact with our credit card company to try and get it back. Essentially this post to help other enjoy traveling as much as we do and not fall victim to these companies traps.",2022-12-13 16:23:10

I have been a Gold Canopy/President's Circle member of Hertz for years and rent cars for business travel 25+ times a year. Recently, the Gold board at BOS told me to go to the counter to get a car. I was told ""something had expired"" but was not told what (I know for a fact nothing had expired). I have another rental tomorrow so I contact Hertz to make sure everything was ok. I was told the ""bypass counter feature was set to NO"" on my account and that ""maybe (I) did this in (my) account unknowingly."" I asked where that setting is made to try to figure out what I might have accidentally changed and was basically told that I do not have access to change that setting. In other words, Hertz changed the setting but won't tell me how or why. I was told to ""rest assured"" that this is ""fixed on our end"" but that is not satisfactory. Has this happened to anyone else? Any ideas why or how this was done? If I had not contacted them, I would have had the same problem on tomorrow's rental. (Note that I know I won't have a problem because I cancelled the Hertz rental and switched it to National. I told Hertz that I would not rent from them again until I was sure this was fixed, i.e. until they could give me an explanation. Not surprisingly, they did not seem to care).",2022-12-13 15:58:12

I suppose a few of my questions are:

1. Is that decent distribution of time? Should we maybe leave and get into Colmar the evening of the 5th day? I know these are tiny details, but I want to make sure I get the most of my time in these areas.
2. I know people mention Colmar as part of the wider Alsace region—but I'm a bit overwhelmed with where to start. What other towns should I visit? Can I do a day tour around the area? Is 2.5 days enough time to manage this? I want to note, I do want my experience in Colmar to be relaxing; I want to do and see things but I do not want to be on a super tight schedule.
3. Weather advice for this area in March? I know Paris will be chilly and assuming it will be here, too, but always love to hear firsthand experience!

Online this is easily possible, and I can buy 20kgs for 19$. However, what they do not specify is, if I could then only take 2 baggage’s, each 20kg with me, or can add to my one, and only checked-in luggage that I have with me, the additional purchased baggage.

I am planning a trip to South Korea and Japan this coming March. The most affordable way I found so far is to book a round-trip ticket to South Korea and another round-trip ticket to Japan leaving from Seoul (two itineraries). Would I hit any major or minor hurdles if I do it this way?

Plan:

* Flying out from the US to Korea then immediately (same day) fly out to Japan with a 2.5 hour window between flights. Est. time arrival is 4:30am and my Japan flight is at 7am.
* Fly back to Korea after a week and stay for the remainder of my trip before flying back to the States.

A few questions too:

* Will immigration take more than 2.5hours if my arrival time is 4:30am? Is this enough time for me to catch my Japan flight?
* Should I book a later Japan flight to include enough time for potential delays?
* Am I correct when I say, I believe once I arrive in Korea, I will have to go through immigration, pick up my luggage, and check in & security for my Japan flight.
* Will I need 2 K-ETA for Korea? One for the first flight entering the country and another when I’m coming back from Japan.

Accidentally yesterday i read a post wich claim this ban apply for ALL travel to Cuba and I panicked.

I visited Cuba in 2016. Got a stamp on my passport.

I looked for official infos on web but the only ""official"" statements are from US Embassy in France wich specify:*"" Additionally, if you have traveled or resided in* ***Cuba*** *on or after January 12, 2021, please be advised that you will need a visa in order to travel to the U.S.""*

And on IATA timatic system wich report same info:

*Passengers who have been in Cuba on or after 12 January 2021 are not allowed to enter with an ESTA authorization*.""

Day allocation: SF - L.A. - Las Vegas,1,zkpuf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zkpuf4/day_allocation_sf_la_las_vegas/,21,1670916988.0,"Dear travel folks,

I just got a question regarding how I will spent my SFC-LA-Las Vegas-SFC days.

*Important info: I won't rent a car so I am focused on walking, PublicTrans and in worst cases Ubering as I am on a budget.*

This saturday I'll go to San Francisco and stay there until the 20th of december (like 3 days).

In the evening of the same day I'll take the bus to L.A. overnight. I'd like to spent at least 2 days in L.A. - 1 day doing a city tour where I peek at much as possible for example using a hop-on bus (no car!) or a guided tour and 1 day at the universal studios.

My following plans  were to go to Las Vegas for 2 days (23rd - 24th) and then fly back to SFC on 25th where I will leave three days later in the morning.

As I think it could be too many days just in SFC, I thought about different options:

\- One would be to use the last days beginning on 25th to make two daytrips to Oakland and Sacramento for a day each and spent the last day again in SFC.

\- Otherwise as I am already driving down to L.A. I could extend my stay for like 1-2 days (Las Vegas is a maximum of 2 days as I am just curious how it looks there and I won't really gamble).  Maybe there would be a closer daytrip possbility in L.A.?

I am that kind of tourist that likes to browse around and explore neighboorhoods by foot, maybe does a few nature trips but city is always fine, mostly keeps it on budget, but will also spend some dollars on touristy stuff. I don't drink alcohol, I am travelling solo, like to find cheap eats (if that helps you in any way to categorize me).

What do you think - how and why would you change the days on this?


EDIT:

Thank you all! 

I will spent 3 days ins SF - 3 in LA - 2 Vegas  and the last two again in SF. 
I won‘t worry about my stay in SFC and just go for it. Will make more detailed destination plans for LA to minimize transport and spend one day in Vegas looking around and one day at Grand Canyon. Last two days in SF will probably be a daytrip.",2022-12-13 09:36:28

I have a fairly negative view of insurance companies, so my immediate thought is that this is just a gotcha.  That if you make a claim they will look for some prepaid, non-refundable trip arrangement that was not insured so they can avoid paying out the reimbursement.  

But, I'm not so arrogant that I think I know more about insurance than I do.  So, what's the validation for this clause? What, if anything, am I missing?

In a bit of a strange situation with an upcoming trip, and just curious if anyone has been in this position before, and if so what you did.

I have a trip in January 2023 booked and paid for, with the following flight originally booked through Philippine Airlines.

21/01 Sydney to Manila  
3hr Layover in Manila  
21/01 Manila to Tokyo (Arriving around midnight)

As such, I have also booked and paid for accommodation on the 21/01 in Tokyo, staying in a hotel at the airport I'm flying into. It's non-refundable.

Yesterday, I received notification that my connecting flight to Tokyo has been cancelled, and I have been booked on a flight the next morning, so that my itinerary is now:

21/01 Sydney to Manila  
16 hr Layover in Manila  
22/01 Manila to Tokyo (Arriving around 2pm)

I'm obviously slightly annoyed to be arriving later, but I understand these things happen. MY issue now is the accommodation for the 21st, having already booked in Tokyo I asked what my options were to the airline. The response was that any changes to schedule shorter than 24 hours are not eligible for compensation or accommodation.

As it stands it seems my options are:

1) Book a hotel in Manila and just front up the cost  
2) Sleep in Manila airport (really don't want to do this)  
3) Keep pushing the airline

As mentioned, I'm curious if this (or similar) has happened to anyone else, and if it has, what success you had with the airline and what you ended up doing.

Iv been doing all of my research that I can and I just want advise on how to make this work. 

My dog is 3 pounds over weight so I do plan on dieting her to get to a healthy 18lb which means with her carrier she may be exactly 20lb or a pound over. How strict are European airlines with the weight? My flight there has my on France Bee and my flight back I’m on Air France. I called and asked this question but the person on the call for both was a person in the USA reading the same travel page I was. I just need to know that when I travel with her, if she goes over the 20 pound limit by a couple pounds what that will look like for me. 

Secondly she is a certified therapy dog, not an ESA, she went through 6 weeks of training and passed the Good Canine Citizens Test and is registered with the AKC as a therapy dog. She is trained to notice anxiety in people and comfort those attacks. I can’t get a straight answer if she qualifies as a service dog or not but I do plan on calling AKC and asking plus my psychiatrist. But I can’t get a straight answer for international travel.

So to start, I was originally planning on flying into Florence but I heard poor things about the airport in Florence (small, many planes rerouted, etc.). So Milan may be a better option from what I have seen/read (cheaper than Rome and better airport than Florence).

As for the trip itself, the plan as of now is to go from Milan to Florence (2 days in Milan and 3 or so in Florence). Florence to Monaco/Nice (I’m a big formula 1 fan), and 2 or so days in Monaco. Then Monaco to Paris (gf hasn’t been to Paris and really wants to visit) and the remainder in Paris.

When it comes to travel while in Europe, the plan is to use trains as much as possible and Uber/Lyft if needed in each city. I have been told this is much cheaper and easier than driving or hiring a driver.

As for the rest of the details, much is up in the air and subject to change. Any and all suggestions are welcome considering this will be our first trip abroad without family/friends. Thanks!",2022-12-13 03:27:55

Travelling for the first time - baggage size limits,0,zkapwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zkapwg/travelling_for_the_first_time_baggage_size_limits/,5,1670877577.0,"Hi all,

I will be travelling for the first time as an adult and I am intending to go carry-on only. The airline allows a carry-on bag as well as a 'personal item' that can be no larger than 40x30x10cm.  


The 40x30 cm isnt really a problem. Going by those limits i can find plenty of backpacks that would be suitable. The 10cm depth however seems like it could be a problem.

I really dont want to get caught out and have to check my main carry on luggage, i would rather just pay a fee to keep both with me at all times, but from what i understand that might not be an option. I just dont want to deal with potentially lost baggage to start my holiday.

Does anyone know, if i were to buy a bag with a max 20cm depth, but only fill it so that it fits the required measurements when squished, would that be accepted by the average airline and even budget ones? Or is it expected to be 40x30x10 in an 'un-squished' state?  


I am flying soon so would really appreciate any advice so i know what kind of bag i should be purchasing!",2022-12-12 22:39:37

We've been refused any sort of assistance with hotels or meals and also told in person at the airport that we can't speak to someone for rebooting and that we can't get our baggage. We have been nothing but cordial despite the increasing frustration. 

Does anyone know if the airline has an idea in advance of what flights it is going to cancel? If they're just stringing us along by booking us onto flights they know won't ship where does that fit in to the whole deal with passengers rights. 

We've been booked another flight tomorrow through their app but frankly I'm 95% sure it'll be canceled by noon tomorrow. Nobody will actually talk to us and we have no idea of how we should normally be treated. If we took the eurostar could we get BA to cover the costs?

I'm heading to Europe in a few weeks and unfortunately I do not have a backpack which meets British Airways requirements for under the seat bag of 16W x 12L x 6D in. The backpack I usually take on domestic flight in the states I have never had a problem with, but it's 2 inches longer than British Airways standards and don't want to risk it.

Has anyone ever used a toddler backpack? The dimensions are perfect, coming in at 12x 11x 5x, but a little embarrassed (although the design of this one in particular you wouldn't know its for kids, except maybe just how small it is.) Do you think the straps would fit an adult?

Pretty much just use it to hold my toiletry bag, JBL speaker, a book, and random little things ect.

A few requirements: good reliable power/internet, safe for a solo woman traveler, tolerant of English speakers, no driving myself required. 

A few preferences: good food, historic architecture, natural scenery nearby.

General Safety of Turkey?,2,zk4ido,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zk4ido/general_safety_of_turkey/,15,1670864209.0,"Hi r/travel, 

I went on my first international trip with a friend this summer (France, Belgium, and a day in Geneva) and it was probably the best 2 weeks of my life. Needless to say, I am looking forward to the next one. 

We are debating between Italy and Sicily, or Greece and Turkey. I am leaning towards Italy and Sicily, but have a high interest in Greece and Turkey as well. My only concern is the general safety of Turkey (I am a sheltered Canadian who is already prone to high anxiety and has only left the continent for the first time on the trip I mentioned).

I really want to visit smaller cities and locations to really ""get a feel"" for the country and what it's like living there - we went to a really small town in Belgium called Tongeren and it was amazing. 

I assume that the bigger cities that are more of tourist hotspots are generally safe (with the exception of normal big city things like petty theft and whatnot, basically Toronto vibes), but is Turkey a ""generally"" safe country for tourists who do not speak the language or know the cultural/societal norms?

I'm also thinking about crossing the boarder to Pakistan and spending a few days in Lahore and I have a few questions about that. Also, my departing and arriving flight are from New Delhi so I always need to return to the starting point.
For context, I have to work a bit while travelling so usually travel a bit slower and mostly low cost.


Right now the itinerary I have in mind is the following:

__



25 to 28 - New Delhi - Rest a bit from previous trips and do some light exploration

28 to 4 - Rishikesh - Maybe do some water/adventure activities, also maybe on one or two days visit Haridwar

4 to 12 - Amritsar/Lahore? - This period will be shorter if I can't figure out the border logistics

12 to 21 - Delhi/Agra/Jaipuri - Exploring New Delhi more in depth and do the Golden triangle

__


Feel free to comment on it and give some suggestions.

Now onto to the questions.

1) Around Agra I read about some places of interest like Fatehpur Sikri, Gwalior and Vrindavan. Are these places worthy it to make a short stop or should I just do Agra?

2) I read that it's not possible to use the Wagah Border as your first point of entry in India, since I my first point of entry will be New Delhi does that mean I can then use it without a problem? Assuming I get a multiple entry visa since my plan would be to go from Amritsar, spend 3/4 days in Lahore and go back to Amritsar.

3) Some people told me about places like Shimla and Kasol but I didn't really found a cheap way to get there and since I'm not exactly backpacking I would also like to avoid 15h travelling journeys. If there's any option that I'm missing let me know.

4) If don't end up going to Lahore I'll probably try to go to Varanasi, any other suggestion?

"Trip report - North India, including a couple of days solo travel (F); recommendations",23,zjxx6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zjxx6r/trip_report_north_india_including_a_couple_of/,11,1670848762.0,"Just back from two weeks in India, primary purpose of which was a wedding in Amritsar.

I have so many things to say about this fascinating country, which at times completely overwhelmed me, and at others blew my mind with its moments of beauty at every turn. Places visited were Delhi, Amritsar, Taj Mahal and Rishikesh (Tapovan, specifically).

I was nervous about this trip because whilst most of it was spent with friends, I knew there would be some moments I'd have to spend navigating alone as a solo female (airport and train transfers mostly). Almost everyone I knew who had been to India advised me to not do anything solo in India as a woman, but this is hard to avoid when your plans don't quite correspond exactly with other people's.

Most of my observations are below:

1. Scams. Scams are everywhere and makes it hard to ever let your guard down. Immediately upon arrival, after an Indian woman from my flight sorted a taxi for me, I got into a nasty situation where the driver demanded double, in quite an aggressive way. This started the trip on a bit of a sour point and made me very distrustful. Being on your guard all the time can be exhausting after a while, and make you less likely to want to go out and be spontaneous, as I like to do when travelling. Do your research well, as even [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) reviews turn out to be fake, book things in advance or through a trusted hotel staff member, or Indian friend if possible. Travelling with Indian friends makes things much easier. If travelling solo, or only with other white people, then take your time. Don't feel rushed into making a decision about anything, especially at the airport, when everything can feel overwhelming. Also an Indian SIM card is essential in my mind, I would have felt extremely vulnerable without. Buy from the airport, but be aware it might not activate for 24 hours.
2. Appreciate the small moments. Take some time to sit quietly in a little street vendors shop with some masala chai (like 20 rupees from the road-side). Find the quiet gardens, or daily religious rituals, hidden temples, or chat to locals (the ones who aren't out to scam you or have some hidden agenda, many are just interested in your life). There is nowhere on earth that I've been that is quite like India. Everywhere you turn there are small moments of vibrancy, a friendly cow, a beautiful building. Favourite moments include; exploring my friend's temple, which was an indescribable beauty, watching a river-side Aarti (daily sunset blessing of thanks to the River Ganga), sitting in a streetside vendor shop with a toothless man delightedly gesturing about ""cricket"" and England beating Pakistan, little rides in tuk-tuks. There is peace amongst the total chaos, where you won't be hassled.  The thing I most loved was how open and welcoming so many Indians are, especially in Rishikesh where I would just be randomly invited to join in with a badminton game, a board game, or to join a group of Indian backpackers to a waterfall.
3. Everything will go wrong, or take longer than expected, so allow double the time to do anything. Getting to the station or airport, getting through the airport, having hours and hours added onto a tour as the guides show you ""just one more bazaar"", ""just come and meet my friend, the pashmina seller"". Be assertive with people, say no you have to go, don't schedule things too tightly.
4. Get out of the smoggy cities. I think it was important for me to see both sides of India, both the smog, chaos and claustrophobia of Delhi, compared with the mountainous, riverside freshness of Rishikesh. That being said, there are many fascinating sites in Delhi if you have the energy to tackle it - Jama Masjid and Red Fort are recommended but be aware of your belongings and scammers as they are crazy busy areas. The metro is cheap and efficient, but will be jam packed around the busier sites, less so further out of the city. Indian cities are not really walkable, even if it says 15-20 mins by foot. You will have to navigate cows, zero road rules, avoiding human faeces/piss, and motorbikes on the pavement. In future I'd probably just make use of the domestic flights to bypass Delhi. From my brief travels in the North, my most recommended states for a return visit are Uttarakhand and Rajasthan. Also interested in Himachal Pradesh and the Ladakh regions.
5. You will pay more for most things as a tourist, but it'll still be cheap. Entry to museums is often around 6 x more expensive for foreigners, but still... it'll be like £6-15 compared to 60p for locals, which I think is justifiable. One of my biggest sources of anxiety was trying to find working ATMs as Indian streets are really not super pedestrian-friendly - walking around looking for one is a pain in the ass. Opportunities to pay by card were few and far between so make sure you take out enough cash, and keep it in separate places - wear a money belt and don't leave valuables on display in your hotels or restaurants - there are many opportunists. Expect a decent meal between the 200-600 rupee mark (£2-6).
6. Harassment was.... bad. And worse if you are a woman. Selfie requests are endless, begging children following you up the street, as well as people covertly filming you (eg. My uber driver... very creepy). But you can block it out. Just ignore people yelling at you and walk around purposefully. To be honest, most selfie requests were harmless and came from both men and women. Beware that saying yes even once will probably trigger everyone nearby to feel bold enough to ask. You can say no.
7. Foodwise... Amazing stuff if you love Indian food. Avoid anything with tap water in it, cold food, meat and dairy. Best bet is piping hot Indian food and bottled (always check the seal's not broken!) or hot drinks. It's hard to avoid these things all the time though. I was ""careful"", yet still my stomach wasn't great a lot of the time. I didn't get caught short, but Immodium is essential, lol. Even roadside masala chai, I'm a liiittle cynical of, though my friends swore that boiled tap water was fine. Some tap water can be ok if it is filtered by reverse osmosis, as in some restaurants or hotels that are more geared for Westerners.

Would I recommend it for solo travellers? For women, you have to take such extreme caution at all times that it detracts from the enjoyment too much to travel entirely solo. If you have opportunity to see the country from the perspective of Indian friends, then absolutely take it. Otherwise, take caution and do your research well, try not to be on your own for long periods of time if you are female (here and there is okay if you are street savvy and experienced in travelling in non-Western cultures). If you have to travel long-distance solo, then don't take the cheap option. First class AC options by train are still a very reasonable price for foreigners. Shatabdi Express Executive Class was around £14 /1400 rupees from Haridwar to Delhi, very safe, and included a 3-course meal for an extra 368 rupees.

I'm glad I did it, and pushed myself out my comfort zone. Despite being an exhausting place, I've come home with a changed perspective of the world around me and of how 1 billion of our planet live their lives.",2022-12-12 14:39:22

First Time Traveling - need advice on how ambitious I should be,1,zjobbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zjobbp/first_time_traveling_need_advice_on_how_ambitious/,6,1670822482.0,"Hey!  
I am a college student who is traveling alone for the first time ever during my upcoming winter break. I am going to Rome by myself.  
I will have 5 full days to explore around, the 6th day will be focused on getting back to the airport to leave. I was thinking of two options:

1. Simply explore Rome for the whole time - it's my first time traveling, I don't want to get too ambitious
2. Spend 3 days in Rome and 2 days in Venice, if I'm all the way over there, I might as well see as much as I can.

I don't know if I'll get ""bored"" of Rome and want to see Venice as well, because like I said, I might as well if I'm there, but I also don't want to overdo it and be stressing out.

I want to go with the flow and decide what to do when I get there, but I am stressed out about how hotels would work if I decide to go to Venice on the fly. I know its smart to book hotels in advance, but I can't really do that if I don't know what my plan is.

I have always been very interested in geography, and I travel more for the geopolitical aspect rather than wanting to sit on the beach and have an actual vacation. That's why I'm leaning towards wanting to go to Venice as well - to say I've been in two super cool historic cities as opposed to one. A part of me thinks I could be satisfied with having less time in each in order to visit each, but I also haven't traveled and don't know how I'll be feeling.

I have planned the trip that consists of first leg in Japan and then a few days in Seoul. I was planning on bringing many souvenirs from Japan and I am not sure if will I be required to pay customs and tax in both Korea and return(home) country? Is my only option to avoid double tax to mail the souvenirs from Japan directly to my home country?

Review on Breeze Airlines (budget airline that actually isn't mega ass),2,zjkpq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zjkpq0/review_on_breeze_airlines_budget_airline_that/,8,1670814120.0,"I like to travel a lot, and I gotta say, the absolute worst part about traveling now a days is airlines. From price hikes, to mystery fees, to delays/cancellations and zero refunds or impossible to change flights, to customer service that would make comcast blush. 

Here is a new airline called Breeze. Budget airline granted, doesn't fly everywhere. But...they're actually trying. Quick customer service response, delay or cancellation? 100% refund, or easily change your flight no problem. Hell, even the flight attendants are super nice, and on one of the flights I had with them they even let me sit in the front of the plane even though I fly economy. And while they are a budget airline, they actually serve food and drinks and their seats aren't ultra mega ass (\*cough spirit cough\*), and their baggage policy is quite clear with no mystery fees (\*cough again spirit cough\*).  

I'm writing this because when you look online, a lot of the reviews seem negative. I was initially worried if this was even a legit airline. But I had no issues flying with them, and when it comes to budget airlines (e.g. Ryanair, Wow, Spirit, Frontier, etc.) this is definitely one of the better ones. And since they're new, they actually care about customer service (until they get successful enough they can afford to not give a shit).

"I'm going to New York for a week with my mom and siblings, would love to get recommendations",3,zjjj07,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zjjj07/im_going_to_new_york_for_a_week_with_my_mom_and/,17,1670811533.0,"First of all, I should point that I've been doing some research and found some recommendations based on other people's similar interests. TBH, I was surprised that NY wasn't already on the wiki.

I already found a few things I'd like to do, but it won't hurt to hear what other people's suggestions :)

I live in São Paulo, Brazil, so I'm pretty well acquainted with the wonders and perils of a big city. The things I like the most in São Paulo are the cultural venues, such as museums and art exhibitions, the gastronomy (I love to experience all the different foods such a plural city has to offer!), parks (if a park has a museum, or perhaps some sort of nature display, like an orchid garden, it scores high on my list!), and the thousands of ways and locations I can have a beer!

Oh, I should add that I'm a musician (I play the acoustic guitar and a bit of the piano), so I would love anything in that area, ""interactive"" or not. Perhaps point me to a cool jazz bar!

I don't care at all about stuff like the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty, but if there's a touristy thing I really, really should do, I wouldn't be against it. I'm also not a fan of sports in general, so seeing the Mets or the Knicks isn't really my thing.

I figured I got to go to the MoMA, the AMNH, the Met and perhaps Central Park. Top of the Rock also sounds like a cool place to go.

I also would like to eat in a burger joint and pastrami from a deli. Also a bagel, which I always see in TV shows, but never eaten, haha. While reading the Excellent Post from the guidelines, it occurred to me that I should add that I'm looking for both nice meals, as well as street food! BTW, is Benihana (or something similar) still a thing? I've always liked the concept, but never thought about going to the one in São Paulo.

As for my budget, I won't be doing anything really expensive, but overall I'll have a fair amount available for enjoying the city.

I'll be there from December 22 to 29, so I must find something to do during Christmas. I'm an atheist and my family is somewhat catholic, so we wouldn't want to go to a mass or something like that. That's not to say I would oppose visiting old churches for the architecture and stuff, though! My brother who lives there tells me most places will be closed on the 25th, so I'd better have a more detailed plan for that day.

I hope I managed to come as clear and specific as possible, even though I changed a lot of things as I was writing. I'll be very thankful for any and every suggestion!

I’d love to spend it somewhere with a community, where it won’t be odd or uncomfortable that I am there by myself. I’ve looked around for potential family run farms where they allow people to book accommodations but it’s been hard to find something that is more of a ‘join us for the holidays’ vs ‘enjoy our property for the holidays.’ 

I don’t have a budget, I’m traveling out of the southeast (states) and can fly or drive ideally anywhere in the states, and really I would just love to be around snow. I’m in my late 20s and not necessarily looking for a rager, just somewhere where people come together as strangers and spend quality time together in a beautiful place.

Here's the idea so far:  
**12/26:** Arrive in Malaga, wander around

**12/27-12/30:** Based in El Chorro for rock climbing. Also planning to hike the Caminito del Rey.

We'll have a car during this time, so we're also open to other things to do in this area or day trips along the Costa del Sur.

**12/31:** We will be making our way toward Seville, but we'll still have the car so it seems fun to do a bit of a road trip along the way-- maybe stopping in Ronda, or other stops?

Also trying to decide where to stay overnight for New Year's eve-- Seville or a smaller town somewhere. It sounds fun to get a low-key NYE drink or gather in the square for grapes and champagne, but it sounds like a lot of the celebrating is either 'gatherings at home with family' and/or 'getting really dressed up and standing in line for the clubs from 2am 'til dawn' with not a lot in between.

**1/1-1/3:** Seville. Nothing too specific planned yet here. My brother is living there so we'll probably have him show us around. Open to suggestions!

Question: At this point, we will still have a car. Due to the one-way fee, it would be more expensive to return it in Seville versus keeping it the rest of the trip. Is it going to be a huge hassle to have it in Seville and Granada? Not planning to drive it at all within the cities, really, but would need to park it somewhere.

**1/4-1/5:** Granada: we have tickets for the Alhambra. Otherwise nothing much planned yet. The Arab baths look cool, as do the Sacromonte Caves. Open to suggestions.

**1/6 and 1/7:** Granada/make our way back to Malaga for our flight in the afternoon of 1/7. Maybe some roadtripping in between along to the coast?

Unfortunately, there was an incident that occurred in the room across the hall from ours on the first night of our trip.  Through the walls, I heard an enraged man screaming “Are you ready to f****** die tonight?” and “You’re going to die tonight!”, a woman screaming in terror for help, a baby screaming and crying, and glass objects being broken in the room.  I tried to call the front desk and hotel security, without success.  I subsequently left the room and ran to the elevator lobby to try the phone there that states it goes directly to the front desk, also without success. I then took the elevator down to the casino, where I assumed security would be abundant.  When I arrived there, despite my pleas for security to return with me upstairs given my concerns about a woman and/or baby being murdered, security was reluctant to act.  Finally, 1 security guard agreed to return with me upstairs, though he walked the whole way.  When we returned upstairs, the security guard seemed to realize the severity of the threat, and immediately started requesting backup by phone.  However, it took over 15 minutes for anyone else to arrive, during which time another guest popped his head out of his room and yelled “Where the hell is security?” and I was confronted and threatened by 2 guests of the room, which the security guard did nothing to stop.  Eventually, someone who identified himself as the director of security arrived.  He opened the room, finding a woman requesting EMS for an unspecified injury, and broken glass and a red liquid all over the entryway.  He spoke privately with the guests of the room, and emerged to advise that nothing would be done as it was a “private matter.”  I asked him to call the police, and he said the hotel is private property and they do not involve the police in these matters.  I requested that they call the police anyway, and he refused.  Instead, he summoned housekeeping to immediately start cleaning up the scene, including the red liquid.  Finally, I called the police myself and filed a report.  We were offered a room change initially, but after talking to the police they advised they wouldn’t offer anything.  Later, after emailing the general manager, they offered some Hyatt reward points for a future stay.  What are your thoughts about the way r/hyatt handled this situation?

Day 4-6: Wanaka -  hiking Roys Peak, via Ferrata with Wildwire

Day 7-9: Te Anau - glow worm caves or hike to Luxmore Hut, either Milford or Doubtful Sound day cruise, Lake Marian Track and other short walks along Milford Road (considering an overnight cruise) 

Day 10-12: Queenstown - Ben Lomond Track, Glenorchy day trip, vineyards in Gibbston Valley

* 28 - Milan

Do you think we are moving around too much, particularly in Italy?

We were actually thinking of hiring a car in Milan and returning it in Rome before flying out to London, would anyone recommend this over trains?


There was a gap between Paris & Greece so we picked Seville but open to options here (particularly if you think this is too out of the way?)


Greece could also just be 5 days if we got rid of Mykonos.

I live in the UK but my family (including younger sibling that is 13 years old) will be landing in London from Chicago the morning of Dec 12th (we are all US citizens).  We just found out that my younger sibling's US passport expires at the end of January and our flight back from the EU to London is on December 24th and their flight back to the US from London is on December 30th. 

My understanding is that the UK should not be an issue for them to enter because the UK just needs the US passport to be valid for the duration of the stay. However, for the EU (Schengen region), they want passports to be valid for at least 3 months after the date you leave the EU).

So, does the fact that my younger sibling is a minor and traveling with family members that all have passports not expiring any time soon, change anything? We have proof of funds, proof of departure flight tickets, confirmed reservations for accommodation, so I don't think that the EU border officials would have any concern that my 13 year old sibling would overstay their visa except for the fact that their passport expires soon.

Cathay Pacific - excess baggage allowance,0,zinryw,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zinryw/cathay_pacific_excess_baggage_allowance/,0,1670755773.0,"Cathay Pacific has a linear dimension limit of 158cm with a US$200 excess luggage fee.

Help Plan Vietnam Itinerary for January End!!,3,zimzp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zimzp5/help_plan_vietnam_itinerary_for_january_end/,6,1670753538.0,"Hi, I am travelling to Vietnam in January end for my girlfriends birthday, I will be landing in DaNang on 28th Jan & Flying out of Hanoi on 6th Feb evening. I am currently planning the itinerary of the trip and need some help, especially in the second part.

Here is what I am thinking currently:

28th Jan - 29th Jan: Da Nang

29th Jan - 31st Jan: Hoi An + Fly to Hanoi

31st Jan - 3rd Feb: Hanoi + SAPA + Ninh Binh

3rd Jan - 5th Feb: Cat Ba Island | 5th Morning (Day Cruise in Ha long bay) 5th evening travel back to Hanoi

6th Feb: Depart from Hanoi

My girlfriends birthday is on 4th Feb, and she wants to stay at a place near water with internet access. So I am thinking of booking some nice hotel in Cat ba island.

Would staying in Ha long bay a better option than Cat ba? Will it be possible to travel back to Hanoi on 5th evening post the day cruise? If not what would recommend me to do? How can I modify the itinerary?

Apart from entry and exit tickets to Vietnam, I don't have anything else booked.

Thanks!",2022-12-11 12:12:18

Today, when I followed up on the same, the airline mentioned that the bags could now come by Dec 12 and will be delivered by Dec 13, and the dates could change again basis the amount of extra luggage the flight can carry.

This is becoming a real problem for us as we have just moved to Canada on this flight and we have all our stuff in the check-in bags. We have 2 pairs of clothes and some other basic items in our cabin bags that we are managing with, but can't do another 3 days as our winter shoes, thermal wear, and jackets are in the check-in bags.

Today when I spoke to the Air France rep on the phone, she said that I can claim the compensation subject to their agent being able to determine whether the items should be compensated for basis the requirements for them and whether or not they are essential.

Looking for some help on how to go about this and if someone has any experiences that can help, please do share as there is too much subjectivity involved in what an airline agent may deem essential.

Make sure you have a passport.

Make sure you have the correct visa.

Understand that Australia is about the same size as the contiguous United States.

Most Australians speak English.

Australian laws apply in all matters in Australia, US laws are irrelevant.

You may not bring any non prescription drugs into the country. You may not carry any type of weapon. You must drive on the left hand side of the road. You need to use Australian currency.

Australians do not care about your religion, politics, how much you earn or how valuable your possessions are. Do not make conversation about any of these things unless, perhaps, asking for directions to a church or particular shop.

Talking loudly to drown out other conversations is considered rude.

Tipping is unnecessary (people are paid reasonable wages) but feel free to leave loose change in the 'tip jar’ if you don't want to carry it.

Say please and thank you to people providing you with a service.

Make sure to spend some time away from major cities.

I recently though have hit a roadblock in trying to decide on La Paz region or Cancun region for my trip. I would be making this trip either at the very end of the season in La Paz around early April or the very beginning of Cancun's season in late May so Im not sure what to expect in terms of water quality, likelihood of encounters, and quality of trip. Im not much of a touristy type and dont typically enjoy crowds which is one of the reasons I'm hesitant of Cancun; especially if the whale shark trips are going to be absolutely packed with people. I think I would prefer the more natural and authentic feels of the towns of Baja Sur; I just worry about missing out on the Whale Shark season or the waters becoming to murky to enjoy.

I used to LOVE AirB’nB. In fact, I haven’t stayed in hotels since 2016, always choosing AirB’n’Bs instead. I always found them simply better quality — more space and utilities for less money. However, now…sadly I think some precious part of the AirB’nB magic is gone. It’s like it sold its soul. 

The last place I stayed in (November, 2022) had a pretty high cleaning fee AND I was left with a list of chores to do before I left. Actually, I’m neat and tidy so I clean up anyway but what got me most was the little laminated signs hung up everywhere. They all said “If you use it, YOU CLEAN IT”. The last part was in all caps, bolded and underlined. It was like being stuck in a passive aggressive employee break room. Yucky.

And the worst thing is, I felt compelled to keep this feedback private for fear of retaliation from the host. 

AirB’nB have either failed to see this trend coming, or they think its negligible from a business point of view. I guess the gradual swing away from AirB’nB isn’t hurting their balance sheet enough…yet. 

It reminds me a little of the way eBay went. Once upon a time eBay had charm and was all about peer-to-peer commerce. Then all the mass-produced items flooded the site and it’s just a poor substitute for Amazon.

Edit to add: a helpful commenter shared this: https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-is-introducing-total-price-display-and-updating-guest-checkout/
Seems AirB’nB is at least trying to tackle some of the issues. 

Edit also to add: yeah, I know I spell AirB’nB weird now. 😂",2022-12-11 03:26:56

We have 14 days total arrive in Cancun in the evening and flights in the AM so effective 12 free days. Here's an outline:

Day 1 dinner/stay in Cancun downtown

Day 2 rent a car, drive south to Playa del Carmen  probably spend the day on the beach and stay one night here.

Day 3 early drive to Valladolid, pass the day in the city. 

Day 4 early drive to Chichen Itza, spend several hours there possibly return to Valladolid or proceed to Merida

Day 5-8 Merida, I would like to make this sort of our home base for a few days and do some day trips to Celestun, Izamal, etc.

Day 9-13 Holbox relaxing on the beach, quiet relaxing finish to the trip

Day 14 travel home.


Is there anything I'm missing? We're mostly interested in visiting ruins, delicious food, maybe cenotes, some nice beaches and of course the culture. Little/no interest in resort type vacationing. I'm aware that we are skipping over Tulum, my understanding is that it's very touristy and expensive with little in the way of culture save for a few pyramids. Additionally, it is sort of out of the way.

Hoping to do this in a budget friendly way and hit the main highlights of the Yucatan.

If you have any kind of suggestion, like ""this place is best visited in daylight (e.g. garden ecc) or this place is better in the evening (christmas market etc) please tell me.

\-I  will be equally distant from U6 and a tram line 5/37/38. To reach the city center, I would have to change the metro or to walk a bit after the tram. What's the best option? Are the tram reliable and relatively frequent? I don't mind to walk a bit, especially if it's a nice walk in the old town, but that's a thing google cannot help to evaluate: I'm not searching for the most efficient way to travel, rather the most valuable and enjoable. Just want to know if there is something I should consider.

\-I read that there some cheap tickets if you willing to stay standing at Opera House. Is this always true? Are these experience enojable anyway? I would like to attend Magic Flute on Dec 19 but it's too late to buy official ticket. The opera is something like 3 hours and I read that you must queue 2 hours for the ticket, si it may be so much if the experience is not worth.

Thailand advice? few questions and plan,0,zi1cek,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zi1cek/thailand_advice_few_questions_and_plan/,9,1670701109.0,"Hey hoping to get some advice or similar about a last second trip to thailand. Planning about 3 weeks-ish in january

right now im thinking:

arrive in bangkok 2 or 3 days

fly or overnight train up to chiang mai, pai and maybe chiang rai total of 7 or 8 days

something in south thailand, i keep seeing mixed experiences between phuket and krabi/ao nang. some things 
say phuket is to filled with resorts, others say krabi is pretty boring, even seen the food isnt great?

return to bangkok 2 or 3 days and leave

maybe add another country for a quick stop? there's cheaper flights from the us to hong kong, taiwan, and vietnam i think. then go from some other place to thailand.

Im not looking for a beach resort experience, sipping cocktails on a beach isnt really my thing. also in my 30s not trying to party. I think i might skip the full moon party thing, reading its pretty spring break like. not sure what might be a good spot to check out then in the south.

Ayutthaya looked interesting, not sure how it fits in

Are the airplanes and airports a big deal to get through? not to crazy about all the flying it looks like I might have to do, especially if its like get their two hours early, security etc...

looking to try good and interesting food, adventure, hiking, rock climbing looks fun. not to much sightseeing. not trying to listen to house music lol

appreciate any advice!",2022-12-10 21:38:29

Best way to include Italian Alps or Dolomites in 7 day Italy Itinerary,2,zi0za0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zi0za0/best_way_to_include_italian_alps_or_dolomites_in/,4,1670700222.0,"Hi,

I'm planning a \~7 day Italy trip in March (first time), and am trying to squeeze in a trip to either the Italian Alps or Dolomites during that time.

I was thinking maybe we fly into Milan (subject to change if anyone has a better idea) and then either spend the night there, or shoot immediately up to the mountains. After spending a day or so in whichever mountain town, we'd want to shoot down to Florence for 1-2 days, and then finish with whatever remaining time we have in Rome.

What would be the best way to incorporate either the Italian Alps or Dolomites into our trip, and does anyone have any recommendations for towns that would be the easiest to access after flying in? Currently I have Como and Aosta on my radar.

A few good bars would be cool. Good food would also be awesome. We were probably looking for somewhere outside the mainland US. As swimming on a beach would be our main interest, we were ignoring some nice spots in Europe such as Barcelona and Lisbon, since they’d be too cold. 

Our budget is somewhat flexible, but we weren’t looking for anything outrageously expensive.

I recently came back from Thailand and it was an amazing experience, loved every day there. It was actually my first time travelling abroad and did it alone!

Now that I'm back I'm planning on where should I go next?

I honestly loved Thailand so much that I wanna go there again but that would be stupid, especially cause I want to **explore the world**, I'm sure I will go there again eventually but not anytime soon. 

**Anyways, what are some countries you recommend I should visit next?** On the top of my head, I was thinking of Japan but I'm open to suggestions :) 

IM ALSO OPEN TO MULTI-CITY/COUNTRY TRIPS! so I can do like 1 week somewhere and 1 week somewhere else type of stuff. 

By the way, I am avoiding places like Europe and stuff now simply for the reason it is expensive to have a good time there and converting Canadian dollars to Euros is just gonna make me broke there haha, for reference Thailand was dirt cheap and I like countries like that where my money can go a long way and I can enjoy a good time. I will explore Europe for sure one day but just not a priority for me right now. 

Also here is a list of places I do not want to visit for now

* **Russia** (Due to war and what not)
* **North Korea** (I'm sure everyone knows why lol)
* **Australia** (Deadly creatures bugs insects you name it, hate that shit haha)
* **Europe** (Just for now will go later in life for sure)
* **Thailand** (already visited, and definitely will go again later in the future)
* **Mexico** (I guess I could do those 1-week resort things but just heard it overall lame and dangerous, its a maybe for now)
* **Pakistan/India** (Just not my vibe for now, maybe in the future)
* **Dubai** (actually been here before but with family, will go back for sure but its also sort of like Europe where you need a good amount of money to enjoy and since Iv already been here I will skip it for now until later in life)
* **United States** (it's right beside me and not really in the mood to visit it for now lol)
* A few more countries but not worth mentioning, I will just wait for your guy's suggestions and go from there, sorry for rambling on and if I sound picky but it is what it is, let me know where I should visit next. :)",2022-12-10 17:08:01

4 days in Lombok + secret gilis

We are concerned about having too many travel days since I have read that it can be slow and unpleasant, and apparently the fast boat no longer goes from the gilis to Bali anymore.

I gave an honest but unflattering review of the place (nothing nasty though, 3 stars out of 5 in overall, which is my honest assessment)The listing had 8 or 9 reviews with a score of 4.91 prior to my review and the rating score changed to 4.75 after my review).

"I've been given the kindest gift of my life, and now I need relaxing recommendations for Thailand",0,zhtiem,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhtiem/ive_been_given_the_kindest_gift_of_my_life_and/,4,1670681512.0,"Sappy backstory that you can skip if you like -


For the past year I've been struggling a lot with my mental health. I've been on sick pay/benefits whilst trying to manage a long term stress reaction, which has given me issues both mentally and physically. I've struggled with similar things for most of adulthood, but this past year has left me unable to work, and generally functioning badly. Unfortunately this has also meant an extremely tight financial situation, only worsen significantly by the current world economy and inflation. The stress of paying for food and medicine, finding affordable housing and dealing with ""the system"" and the constant pressure to get back on my feet has left me extremely tired and dissillusioned with life and society. 




Someone seeing me from the outside, would probably never think this. I am a 27 year old woman, in Scandinavia. I dress presentably (when I go outside), I am well spoken and articulate and since losing a bunch of weight, due to stress, I guess I'm considered conventionally attractive (this is completely irrelevant to my case, except for how much harder you have to work to convince others that you are struggling)





Obviously my personal finances are abysmal, and I've had to rely heavily on family to make ends meet, which I am very privileged to be able to, but also very uncomfortable with. When recieving the benefits I do, I am not entitled to any money I make or receive outside of the sick pay. 





Christmas time especially is stressful - trying to handmake presents for everyone so I don't feel like the worst person when they inevitably give me presents I've kindly asked not to receive. Traveling with, to and from family, and the cost associated, and obviously the long, cold, days are all taking yet another toll on me.




I realise that I sound like I pity myself enormously, and honestly - by now I do. It's been a hard life, and an incredibly hard year, and some days I am surprised I am still here. Other people have it worse, but that doesn't make me any better. 





By now, maybe you can tell the kind off state I've been in.



Then yesterday, I received a text from my dad 



""Hey, by chance, do you want free return tickets to Thailand between New Years and end of January""
 


Uuuuuuuuuuuh, what. 



Turns out, a family friend had a trip planned with her partner, but they have broken up, and she no longers wants to go. Instead of refunding or selling the tickets, she immediately thought of me, and figured that I deserved a holiday. When I read this, I started weeping in the middle of the street. Obviously it is an extremely generous offer, but just the fact that she thought of me before anything else makes me feel so seen and understood, for the first time in a very long time. 



All of this backstory may be irrelevant to some, but I wanted to paint the picture of the mindspace I'm in, and also tell the story of this wonderful, wonderful person, who I will forever be grateful for 



--------------------------------------------------------------


(If you've skipped the introduction, basically I've been giftet free return tickets to Thailand for a month)


So now to the actual requests -


Obviously the tickets are not the whole trip, and it will take the cutting of some heels and toes, but ultimately I've calculated that I am able to go, and afford the trip. 


That being said, the cheaper the better, since I do have to return to my actual life again upon return. 


Luckily seeing as am mostly hoping to relax and enjoy the culture and nature, I will not need a big budget for tours, trips and parties, although obviously I am not denying that I might engage a little in these things. 



It may be worth noting that I have several years of experience solo backpacking from when I was younger, and so I have the gear and some know-how.



I've drawn up my travel keywords to - Beach, nature, quiet, friendly, slow, sustainable 



I am looking for specific advice and recommendations from experienced travelers and locals, on where to go, and what to do.



- I have researched some work exchange options, so as to save on accommodation, but my experience tells me to hold off on making any arrangements before am I am actually in the country. Does anyone have any advice or experience with this? 





- I thought a lot about whether I'd prefer mountains or beach, and decided beach for now, so I am think of going south - perhaps Krabi/Phuket area, as the Full Moon scene isn't exactly my crowd for now. 
Any advice on specific areas to go to - I realise everyone wants ""off the beaten path"", and as a tourist you will end up in ""touristy"" areas, but seeing as I am not the target audience for many of the tourism offerings, where else could I go? I also am aware that the Thai beaches and such suffer from tourism, so I'd like to at least try not to contribute to overcrowding of certain areas too much ( I am part of the problem, I know)





- I will most likely be flying into Bangkok on the 30th of December. Should I stay in Bangkok for new years and find a party (through a hostel or such), or should I hurry up get to the south in time for NYE on the beach? I am open to both, but would love recommendations, or to know if others are in the area





- As I have a whole month, I will have time to potentially explore several parts of the country. Would anyone recommend this, or to stay in one area?





- Lastly I am fully aware that I have a very Eat-Love-Pray-mentality around this trip, and that backpacking is not always relaxing - but if anyone has a recommendation for a beautiful, not too crowded, cheap and simple place, I can settle in, and spend a month more or less reading, doing yoga and eating fresh fruit on the beach, without having to sell my liver, I would appreciate it greatly - and feel free to send me resources or links to places or people that could be relevant




Thank you so very much in advance, and if no one sees this, at least it was nice to write it all down.",2022-12-10 16:11:52

Met a girl from Germany who's been living there for a couple months now with the goal of escaping her life in her city and to live that island life. She said she was looking for happiness.

Met up with her for some food, hung out on the beach, laughed a lot (one of the few girls I've met who truly enjoyed laughing and even was easy to make her laugh, as she enjoyed it a lot. Though she did say I was a good one who could make her laugh). Had long late night conversations where she opened up about a lot of things, which felt like something real finally. At that moment I knew I was gonna have a crush on her (but not fall in love). I felt like I was reading a story or watching a movie. And I knew I was going to miss it. The night ended with something special in her apartment. 

We continued spending time together for a couple more days and finally it was time for me to leave the island. She met up one last time in the morning to give me a kiss and a hug. I felt sad. Very happy, but sad. She sent her last message as I was taking off. ""Thank you for all"".

I’m on the plane flying back home. What an amazing experience I had! All the shopkeepers and waiters were nice and patient with our horrible French. The food were great. The museum was awesome. The architecture and scenery were breathtaking. People were genuinely happy when I attempted to speak French. The streets were mostly safe*. We stayed west of the Eiffiel tower and walked around the Lourve area. We also visited the arc and Monmartre. 

* My only negative experience was some man walked up to me and reached out his hand trying to touch my fur jacket. I ran and he shouted some stuff to me in French. Then another guy just chatted with me in a mix of French and English and offered me weed me while I was sitting at the bench to take a break from walking. All this happened on pont des arts and Rue de Rivoli. 

This experience made me feel a little disturbed, but it’s nothing compared to what I’ve read and heard like people getting robbed and grabbed and things like that.

Peru: Recommendations and Advice!,2,zhqabb,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhqabb/peru_recommendations_and_advice/,5,1670671678.0,"Hi everyone I was hoping to get some help with a few questions I have pertaining to Peru and the Inca tail. At the bottom I have included a TL;DR as I didn’t realize how lengthy this was going to end up.  

Hiking the Inca Trail to Maccu Piccu is on my bucket list and I figured that I would start planning this trip for this upcoming April/May. I have looked through a few different posts on this subreddit but still wanted to make my own post.  

I have previously walked the Camino de Santiago (Frances route – including crossing the pyrenees) but that was in 2018 and mostly more of a walk than a hike per say. I am now a 27F that trains and competes in Olympic weightlifting. I will be incorporating some inclined walking/stair stepper into my training as I no longer train for stamina and believe I will need some help in that area. I was wondering if any others who have completed it followed any specific training or felt that it was needed? I do live at an elevation of just below 550m – quite the difference from peak elevation along the trail.  

I have seen a few different guide options that have been suggested. I was thinking about maybe going with G adventures but am definitely open to other suggestions. I know G adventures offers the option to be met in Lima and then head to Cusco together... but I was originally thinking of making my way to Cusco alone after flying into Lima. Would this be safe? I have traveled extensively through (mostly western) Europe but this will be my first time to South America.  

Following the Inca Trail and heading back to Cusco I was thinking about also hiking up to see Rainbow Mountain since I will be in the area and already (hopefully) acclimated to the approximate elevation. Does anyone have recommendations on which group to book with to do this? I was thinking about maybe AB Expeditions since they leave early and try to arrive ahead of crowds but maybe there are better options.  

Finally, because I will have three weeks off work, I would be open to including a trip down into the Amazon Jungle from Cusco. Have others found this worth it? This could potentially be my only chance to visit Peru (the world is large and I want to see/do so much) and I want to make the most of it. 

Thank you for any recommendations or insight you may have into this subject! 

 

TL;DR 

How fit were you before/did you implement a specific training program 

Tour guide recommendations for Inca Trail  

Is it save to travel around alone as a single female e.g from Lima to Cusco 

Guide recommendations for Rainbow Mountain hike 

Is the Amazon Jungle worth going to

Are there any other need to see/do places or things

Planning and budgeting a gap year,1,zhpa2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhpa2b/planning_and_budgeting_a_gap_year/,4,1670668493.0,"Hey everyone, I'm 17 and from the UK, I've known for a very long time that I'm taking a gap year because I may be looking forward to uni but I love travelling and need a break from education too.

Now that I'm starting to look into planning it at least with a vague itinerary it's very daunting. I was extremely split between Asia and South America but I think I want to do Asia because I get the feeling I'll be better doing South America when I'm more experienced with traveling and know what to be looking out for.

with this in mind, I also think I may go to a European country first, I think starting off in somewhere in Europe will ease me into solo travel a bit better and I really wanna go to certain places like Portugal anyway.

But really what I'm asking is how do I plan this on as small a budget as possible, I'd say I have about £4000 to spend, and it seems like flights take up a huge amount of that, surely there's some tricks to getting cheaper flights to somewhere like Thailand? I know that you can get by in South East Asia on a small budget and that exactly what i want to do but the flights seem like a massive amount, in an ideal world I'd love to go to Australia whilst I'm over in SE Asia since it's a much more convenient opportunity than going from the UK but I simply don't think I've got the budget for that 

any advice on how to start planning and how best to budget for my gap year will be really appreciated.

I was visiting my long distance girlfriend I Peru, when she and I got into a pretty big fight and she ended up breaking up with me. 
So now here I am, stuck in Peru, not really sure what to do. I've never been solo travelling before, and have heard some bad things about thieves, bad taxis, scams and all sorts of stuff like that here. My main goal is to just be sure I can get home.
I downloaded Uber, but I'm not too sure if it's 100% safe for tourists anyways. My Spanish is very basic. 
I'm currently in the smaller town of Lurin, which is only about an hour by taxi to Lima Downtown and the airport.

If any of you can just give me tips or any sort of help, it would be GREATLY appreciated.",2022-12-10 06:13:57

Lake como (not sure which town to use as a base maybe Lecco or Belaggio) 2 nights potentially rent a car

Florence with a day trip somewhere in Tuscany 3 nights

Amalfi Coast maybe stay in Positano and day trip to Capri 3 nights ditch the car on the way

South America (Bolivia) first time,3,zhasyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhasyc/south_america_bolivia_first_time/,1,1670624970.0,"Hello,

I'm looking to go to Bolivia and stay there for a while but I haven't been outside of Europe before.

I have a couple of questions regarding the requirements that I need to meet.

* Do I need to show a return ticket as well on arrival to be allowed into the country? I don't know how long I will stay for so I would like to buy it while I am already there and when I feel like it.
* Do I need a yellow fever or any other vaccinations? I know they are recommended but are they mandatory? I read that yellow fever vaccination is only mandatory when you go to Bolivia from a country that has yellow fever (Brazil, Peru). I plan to stay in Bolivia only. Also in case that my flight to there would go through Sao Paulo, Brazil for instance then does it already count as going to Bolivia from a high risk country? Or does it not count because I will just be in the airport for a couple of hours long layover.
* And for the ""big 19"" it is only necessary to show the PCR or antigen test? Where can I do these? Is it possible to do them in airports or is that more expensive? Due to layovers the entire trip may take even 40 hours. What if I do it early and the 72 or 48 hours ends maybe right before my flight from Brazil to Bolivia?
* I may be going very soon if everything works out perfectly. Does someone know good ways or tips to finding cheap last minute plane tickets?

I am planning to visit the Netherlands in my summer vacation. I am an Indian national in the UK pursuing my undergraduate degree as an international student. My reason for travel is because my girlfriend lives in the Netherlands and and I am visiting her. She has visited me a few times but this will be my first time visiting her, so I am very excited to see where she lives and travel to other EU countries. I will only stay in the UK and work for two months to support my expenses in the Netherlands, otherwise I would go home for the summer. I will provide a letter of invitation from my girlfriend as I am planning to stay with her. I am quite worried after reading a lot of rejection cases. I have no travel history outside of my home country and I wanted to know my chances before booking summer housing in the UK. If my chances are not great, then I would prefer to not spend that much money and not go through all that hassle and just go home.

Frontier Airlines lol,0,zh8eei,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zh8eei/frontier_airlines_lol/,3,1670619173.0,"TLDR; Never fly Frontier.
———————————-
ME: So as a customer, I should be tracking all of the associated cost changes for flights that you cancel and inform the ticket agent to review my receipts
 
FRONTIER: Yes…
———————————-



FRONTIER: Thank you for your patience. You are contacting us regarding refund. I’ll be more than happy to assist you. Let me take a look at your reservation first, one moment.
 
ME: My flight was cancelled (DCA-LAS) after I made the seat purchases. I noticed after getting my new ticket (BWI-LAS) that they didn't account for my seat purchase. I'm looking to get a refund for the seat on that flight. I also see a negative balance on the app via my account for $10. It sums up to $60 refund (-$10 balance and $50 for the seat BWI-LAS). Are you able to help me with this?
 
ME: To clarify, I was given a random seat for BWI-LAS when I purchased a seat prior to the cancelation on my original flight.
 
Frontier: I am sorry but we cannot process refund for the bags and seats. As per bag policy, bags are nonrefundable. You may refer online to https://www.flyfrontier.com/travel/travel-info/bag-options/ for more information about bags. Especially the flight was already in boarded status.
 
ME: No need to refund the bag as I did check my bag... However, my original flight was canceled. When the ticket counter rescheduled my flight they gave me a random seat, when I previously made a specific seat purchase. Thus I never sat in a seat I selected.
ME: Also, there is a negative $10 balance in my frontier app. For the $10 balance.... Seats $104 + Bags $107 = $211. I was charged $221. This is because the original flights from DCA-DEN DEN-LAS was cancelled. This must be a remaining balance for the difference in price of the seat purchase to when it changed to a nonstop flight (BWI-LAS).
 
FRONTIER: As per checking, the $221 was the one you paid for the bags an dseat after you book the ticket not after the changes.
 
ME: Additionally, the cost of the seat for BWI-LAS is $50... They cancelled my original flight that I paid seats for, gave me a new flight (BWI-LAS) and still kept the paid seat on my bill. I never sat in a seat I paid for. Why would I pay extra for a random seat.
ME: Correct, I was charged $221 for bags and seats. I should only be charged $161 ($28+$26 (Seats) +$56+51 (Bags))
 
FRONTIER: I understand. You need to approach an airport agent about your request refund since w eno longer have any other options since you already took the flight.
 
ME: Why would I travel to an airport and pay $20 to chat with an agent.
 
FRONTIER: Because we no longer could not do anything on this since the flight was boarded. You already took the flight. Once a flight is boarded we frontier customer chat service don't have any option for it any longer. The airport will be the one to compensate you or refund it to you.
 
ME: Ok, how about the $10? If the seats and bags were added that only equals $211. I was charged $221
 
FRONTIER: We could not see any $10 credit here on the reservation. That was already forfeited.
 
ME: Thats not really convienent as the Frontier booth is only open 2hrs before a flight and it was Frontier that cancelled the flight.
ME: Currently my bank statement shows a completed (not pending) purchase of $221. I don't see any credit of $10
 
FRONTIER: I understand. However this was already a boarded status of teh flight. Only if it is not boarded yet, we could get more options.
 
ME: So as a customer, I should be tracking all of the associated cost changes for flights that you cancel and inform the ticket agent to review my receipts
 
FRONTIER: Yes, if you already took the flight. The only problem here why we cannot process your request is because the flight was boarded.
 
ME: Is there a phone line or email that can do this? Not sure why I have to go out of my way for a refund that I will have to argue for onsite
 
FRONTIER: We no longer have any phone number. And even if we have an available customer service on the phone, still they could not process it since we do follow the same process and tools.
 
ME: Thats very sad, I'm suprised to see Frontier still operating. I would leave employment from Frontier ASAP if thats the kind of penny pinching policy they have.",2022-12-09 22:52:53

Any phone plans to keep my US number active while in Japan long term?,1,zh826f,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zh826f/any_phone_plans_to_keep_my_us_number_active_while/,12,1670618344.0,"Hi there everyone, hope you’re doing well.

I’m currently in the middle of preparing things for a visit home to the US from Japan, and it wasn’t until the last second that I realized that after porting my American phone number to Japan using Google Voice (I have a Japanese prepaid plan here since I’m living long term), I have no way to get cell reception in the US. I’m using Google Voice to stay in touch with people back home and conduct business with them using an American number, and the $20 porting cost to use on data seemed like a good deal until recently.

I’m aware I can port my number to a new service provider for just the month, but it seems annoying to do all of that when I’m only staying for less than a month, and then they might try to keep my number for a few months anyways before they’ll let me port it back to Google Voice.

Even so, I figured it’s time to see if there are phone plans that I can use that will give me coverage within the US but also not hit me with any penalties or cancellations for having my phone abroad. I’m open minded when it comes to budgets as well since I used to have both T-Mobile and au at the same time here in Japan. Eventually, T-Mobile warned me that they would soon penalize and cancel my entire plan and phone number if I didn’t re-enter the United States soon, so I had to port my number to Google Voice and abandon my plan with T-Mobile.

I absolutely need both numbers to work on my phone at all times regardless of how long I visit home or stay in Japan. I’ll turn off my Japanese data when I’m in the states and just use my US data as is usual, and I’ll prioritize my Japanese SIM data when I’m in Japan. I use an iPhone 13, I might upgrade to the iPhone 14, if that makes a difference.

Thanks in advance!

Is there an easy guide for Americans to quickly learn road rules in Germany and Austria? I never drove in Europe, and I know some basic things (like white lane markings and different signs), but I am sure there is more to it.

And if there is no such guide, is it an option to take, say, a British or Irish driver's manual (and switch sides ofc), or there is actually a significant difference between regions in Europe?

Thank you.

P.s.: judging by downvotes, it may look like a dumb/lazy question, but really I saw several guides completely overlook things even I know. And they are all very basic. For example, in the U.S. & Canada, the default right of way in the absence of yield signs is different from that in Europe. Most articles I found overlook different road markings. In the USA, you can turn left over a double solid line; you only can't turn around or overtake. In Europe, you can't do either. Americans use yellow color to denote the separation of sides of roads, and Europe uses yellow color to denote temporary markings (like road work). Traffic light rules are entirely different. But these are the things I just randomly happened to know. There has to be some resource to learn the differences.",2022-12-09 20:39:19

Our main goal is to visit the places where part of my family has studied before and where I'm studying. My family said they're okay with not getting to know each city deeply as they understand it is quite packed already. The big cities are Budapest, Prague, Berlin, and Amsterdam. While the study towns are Braunschweig, Delft, and Gyor.

# Rough Itinerary

26th: Arrive in Budapest in the afternoon, rest for a bit, and tour the city in the evening.

27th: Touring Budapest, and leaving for Prague with a night bus. 

28th: Arrive in the morning in Prague and stay for one night.

29th: Bus/Train to Berlin arrive around noon and stays for one night.

30th: Left Berlin at around 10 for Braunschweig, Braunschweig day trip, continue to Amsterdam from Braunschweig transit in Hanover and arrive around 9 pm.

31st-3th in Amsterdam: Father has a friend there to show and drive us around if needed, and will probably do a few day trips (Delft and Aachen primarily) with a base in Amsterdam.

4th-8th: flight to Budapest and tour with a day trip to where I'm studying (Gyor). We had to stay in Budapest/Hungary for the longest for visa reasons. We are also able to rest here.

9th: flight back to Southeast Asia.

I think the itinerary is too packed, but even after talking to my family about it, they don't budge. If push comes to shove, I'll probably omit Prague and fly to Berlin instead but I'm still not sure about it plus it's my sister's first time in Europe, and I think Prague will be wonderful for her.

Obviously racked up some purchases as well and we got some conflicting advice about how to file for the tourist tax refund (VAT). At a mall in Copenhagen, we were told not to file the paperwork until we left Norway for Switzerland, but once in Norway, we were corrected by our tour guide that Norway is not in the EU and that we should have filed before leaving Denmark. 

So we ended up filing it at the Zurich airport before leaving Switzerland. Person at the customs kiosk seemed like all was in order and even offered to mail it for us. So we thought all was good. We both bought watches there and I got a few clothes so the refund would have been several hundred at least.

I'm planning a solo trip along French Mediterranean. I'm mainly in the mood for cultural sights, architecture, cozy town quarters, and good food.  I've scouted a few places I'd like to stop by, for reference I'm planning on going via rail.

My plan is to land in Barcelona and then catch a train to Montpellier and spend a few nights there. After that I want to head to Marseille for a  few nights, then spend a night in Nice before taking a flight home.

I haven't really made out any dates yet as I'm unsure how much time I'll need, but I plan on going in April next year.

Béziers

Nîmes

Sète

Aix-en-Provence  

Avignon

Arles (Nature Reserve?)

How are these towns and cities? Are they worth a stopover or even a night? I  find Avignon and Arles the most interesting but I wouldn't want to miss out on these smaller towns now that I am on the right route. Are there any other places worth a visit along the way that I haven't included?

Petra Hikes,5,zgysjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zgysjg/petra_hikes/,4,1670596224.0,"Hello, 

We made a final decision to book our trip to Jordan for a week in April. But after reading article after article, I am having a hard time deciding how long we should spend at Petra. We plan to be there on the second day of our journey. On day one we plan on arriving to Queen Alia's Airport @ 4PM. Then we are hoping to rent a car then take our time to drive to Wadi Musa. We ideally hope we will be renting a car from the airport (heard it was relatively easy). 

The next morning, hopefully earlier rather than later, we want to be on the ground at Petra. We really can only spend a day here with everything that we are wanting to do. But in terms of hiking/sites we are overwhelmed by what there is to do. 

We know we definitely want to take the visitor center to The Treasury or known as ' The Main Trail'. Then we wonder how difficult the Treasury Viewpoint is and if it's easy enough then should we do it while we're at The Treasury the first time or should we just wait until we come back from whatever trail? 

From the Treasury we are not sure if we would want to go to the High Place of Sacrifice Trail or continue on towards the Wadi Farasa Trail. Or if we should even continue after we do The Main Trail? 

Then would most people say it is worth working our way towards The Monetary Trail or should we stop at whatever our decision is from the Prior Trails. 

Either way, as we have our trip planned out on paper, is we would end up in Wadi Rum towards the evening time. We do not plan on doing anything in particular except for sleeping, enjoying a Bedouin dish, enjoying some tea, and relaxing at whatever camp site we decide. Unless Reddit commenters suggest we skip Wadi Rum, but we have seen that it is a must do area of the Middle East.",2022-12-09 16:30:24

On Tuesday, visit Sintra and its attractions and Cabo de Roca. Should I do this myself or take a day trip on a guided tour to also see Cascais ?

On Wednesday, I want to check out Obidos and I would take the train ride up there and back to Lisbon. 

On Thursday, fly out to Porto and spend the day there and either fly back in the evening or Friday morning.

Itinerary Review Request: Switzerland and Italy trip in January,1,zgqv2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zgqv2d/itinerary_review_request_switzerland_and_italy/,6,1670572926.0,"Hi Everyone,

I am going a solo Europe trip in January and hoping to cover Paris, Switzerland and Italy over 16 days. I am looking for your advice, suggestions and opinions on my current plan outlined below:

* 30 Dec'22 - 4th Jan'23: Explore Paris
* 4th Jan: Travel to Zurich and stay at Lucerne
* 5th: Check out Interlaken
* 6th: Visit Grindelwald and Jungfrau region; back to Interlaken

After this I am a bit confused on whether I should go to a) Zermatt and take the Glacier express to St Moritz OR b) go to Chur and take the Bernina express to Tirano, Italy.

I feel that 8 hour journey from Zermatt to St Moritz might be too much take in on one day and St Moritz in itself doesn't seem that exciting to me. Moreover, going to Italy from St Moritz after the Glacier express doesn't look straightforward. Thus, I am inclined towards option b).  However, I would really like to hear your thoughts on this!

* 7th: Travel from Interlaken to Chur and explore it a bit
* 8th: Take Bernina express from Chur to Tirano and explore Tirano afterwards
* 9th: travel from Tirano to Florence
* 9th, 10th and 11th:  Explore Florence
* 12th, 13th and 14th: Explore Rome
* 15th: Flight back home

I enjoy hiking, scenic outdoors, cute cafes, vegan/vegetarian food and walking around pretty towns. I'm super flexible with my current plans and not too worried about budget either. I am female traveling alone so safety is one thing I do want to prioritize. So, please let me know what you think of this itinerary and share any suggestions to make it better.

Looking for itinerary advice for Italy in early July!,1,zgk7u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zgk7u0/looking_for_itinerary_advice_for_italy_in_early/,6,1670552817.0,"Hello! I’m looking for advice on which destinations in Italy to choose for early July. 

For context:
- timing is non-negotiable, it has to be July for a variety of reasons (mainly timing of fertility treatments that will be out of our control) 
- I know it will be hot and crowded due to high tourist season
- I have been to Rome, Florence, Bologna, and Venice (a long time ago in college, on a very strict budget); my wife has never been to Italy 

We will have about 8 days—landing on a Saturday morning, departing the following Sunday. 

Given our limited time, we only want to choose two stops. Priorities are a combo of sightseeing and relaxation, which we feel like we could get at any of these locations.

Here’s what we’re thinking of as options:
- Florence and Cinque Terre
- Venice and Lake Como
- Rome and the Amalfi coast (hoping for specific recs here, thinking we might add a third stop if we go with amalfi—some combo of Sorrento/Ischia/Capri/Positano)

We’re open to other suggestions as well! We love going off the beaten path, but we don’t want to rent a car so ideally no complicated airport transfer/places that can’t be reached by train or bus or not-too-expensive private car hire.

I’m thinking the weather might be more bearable in the north? Our ideal (in terms of what we’d like to do) would probably be Rome and Lake Como, but traveling between the two seems like a nightmare, unless anyone has suggestions for this?)

-	specific resorts to absolutely stay away from? 
-	all inclusive or pay as you go? 
-	local customs/policy we should know about?
-	of the islands/resorts, are there any that are “unsafe?”

However, my passport expires in May 2023, which means it has only five months validity.

Normally, US citizens would be eligible for a visa on arrival, but since that requires six months validity, I’m worried they might deny me the visa. I have reached out to a travel agency to see if they can provide me with a 48-hour transit visa, which only requires three months passport validity. Just in case that doesn’t come through though, I wanted to ask the community:

* Is there any chance my airline denies me boarding for my flight departing the US? Note that my itinerary consists of two separate airlines: from USA to Sharjah is Qatar Airways, then from Sharjah to India is Air Arabia. I have a single ticket which lists both flights, but it also says that I am responsible for a ""self-transfer"" between the two airlines. 
* If and when I reach the UAE, how likely is it that the immigration officer would actually deny me a visa-on-arrival based on the six months validity rule?
* In case I am not able to get the transit visa, would it be possible for me to just stay airside the whole time, until I can board my onward flight to India? From my research, it seems that the Sharjah airport is very small, and there’s only one terminal. So, hopefully there would not be any immigration desk in between the gate where I arrive and the gate where I need to depart from. If anyone who has been to the Sharjah airport could confirm this, I would appreciate it so much!

Note that I am not worried about the immigration procedures in India, since I have OCI status which means I am exempt from the six months validity rule as far as India is concerned.",2022-12-09 02:27:53

We are flying from California into Singapore to start our trip to visit old friends and plan on staying with them for two days before continuing our trip. Our return flight is from Bangkok. In between we plan on spending time in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand.

We have never traveled to Asia before, but we are experienced travelers in other areas of the world (Central and South America, Europe, etc). There is so much to see, but I want to make sure we are choosing the right spots and not ""over doing it"".

For some context on how we usually travel: We are both very active and like to see a lot while traveling. Most of our traveling has a mix of history, nature, foodie tourism, and cultural/artistic sites. We normally stay at AirBnBs and generally avoid large group tours, but I am open to feedback on how best to approach these areas.

After doing research I put together the below mock itinerary. I have been considering removing Chiang Mai or Thai beach/islands and taking more time in other areas we are already visiting. Would this be a mistake - is doing both feasible? If forced to choose between the two which one would you pick? There are many other areas I wish we could spend more time in, but there is already a lot of jumping around as is.

Does anyone have any feedback on changing anything with this plan? Any destinations you would add/remove?

2/1 wed - fly (flight to singapore is already booked)

2/2 Thurs - fly/arrive

⅔ Fri - singapore (staying with friends)

2/4 sat - singapore

2/5 sun - travel to hanoi (AM flight). This is probably the city/area I am most interested in visiting due to the really positive feedback we received from friends who have gone here.

2/6 monday - hanoi

2/7 tues - day trip from hanoi (ninh binh possibly?)

2/8 wed - ha long bay (2.5-3 hr bus ride from hanoi)

2/9 thurs - ha long bay, return to hanoi

2/10 fri - travel from hanoi to siem reap (we are very excited to see angkor wat)

2/11 sat - siem reap/angkor wat

2/12 sun siem reap/angkor wat

2/13 mon - travel from siem reap to chiang mai

2/14 tues - chiang mai

2/15 wed - chiang mai (would a day trip in this area make sense? any recommendations? \*edit - I meant to ask a day trip outside of chiang mai, but in the surround area. Sorry for any confusion\*)

2/16 thurs - travel

2/17 fri - thailand - beach/island (Have seen a lot of different places recommended - like Koh Kood, Krabi, Koh Samui, Koh Samet. Would love your thoughts on this.)

2/18 sat - thailand - beach/island

2/19 sun - AM travel to bangkok

2/20 mon - bangkok

2/21 tues - AM fly to US

Beyond the planned itinerary, any tips or advice on this trip would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!",2022-12-09 02:07:06

Comment,1,j0o6eur,,0,1671335556.0,"This super sucks, and I'm sorry you're in this situation.

I've also learned the hard way that travel insurance covers ""stuff that happens to you AFTER it happens to you"" and NOT ""stuff you decide not to do even if it's for good and sound reason."" Most travel insurance policies consider making personal safety decisions to fall into the latter category. 

But read your policy! I'm not sure if Expedia's coverage is an add-on that provides minimal coverage or if you got a more robust plan. That said, I always buy the ""robust plan,"" to the tune of a couple hundred dollars for every trip, and those don't cover civil unrest unless it renders lodging uninhabitable or results in the airline cancelling the flight (which the airline would refund you for anyway). 

I hope you can make use of those airline credits to go somewhere. I'm so sorry. I hope you are blessed with good luck for future travel.",2022-12-18 05:52:36
Comment,1,j0o6adx,,0,1671335493.0,So glad I found this post because I just visited LA for the first time 2 weeks ago. I arrived Saturday morning and Ubered to six flags magic mountain because it’s one of the best roller coaster parks in the world but sadly over half the rides were closed so it was kinda a let down so don’t bother with that. From there I ubered to Hollywood walk of fame and walked all the way to Beverly Hills like 6 miles and walked through it and all of that was just beautiful. I even made it to Rihanna’s mansion. Then I ubered to Santa Monica pier/beach and ate at the bubba gump there. The pier was beautiful at night. I got a hotel around there last minute for 240. Next morning I checked out the beach again which didn’t have much going on since it’s the winter season although it was still pretty. Then I ubered south like 55 minute drive to the USS Iowa battleship museum which is a pretty big ship that you can explore for like 20 bucks. That was pretty cool. Then I had nothing else to do so I started walking back north to the airport to save a bit of money on the Uber I made it like 6 miles on foot and checked out a strip club which was pretty dead inside so I finally ubered to the airport and flew home that Sunday night. I told an Uber drive everything I did he said you did more in 2 days than I’ve done in 24 years living here.,2022-12-18 05:51:33

Comment,1,j0o5tz4,,0,1671335257.0,"December means Christmas Markets in many parts of Europe.. generally, they run through Advent, but it does vary by region/country and city/towns.  Check this years opening dates to get a feel for next year’s…we’ve done a few “fly out on Thanksgiving Day” trips and found it a little too early for some CM’s (not open yet), including this past month.

FYI, [this Rick Steves link](https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/travel-classes/monday-night-travel/european-christmas) can give you some insight.

We’ve done this sort of trip several times; we’re museum buffs, so our general strategy is to hit a museum in the morning, hit a CM for a quick lunch break, more general sightseeing in the afternoon (maybe through another CM if it’s a bigger city with multiple CM’s), then a break, and then out at dusk to another CM for hot mulled wine & street food dinner & the night ambiance.  FYI, Germany is the classic ‘ground zero’ for CM’s, but there’s good CM’s elsewhere too.

For itinerary planning based on 6-10 days, I’d figure just 1 to 3 locations & in the same region (or fast train connect). Personally, I like 3 night stays before moving on.  If you pick bigger cities, you can skip the cost of a rental car, as mass transit in EU is great.  FYI, reason I started at just one (1) destination location is because if 6 days includes travel time from the US & return, you’re looking potentially at having just 4 days, one of which is your jet lag recovery day of arrival.  

Finally, from a planning standpoint, job#1 starts in January: make sure everyone has passports and they’re not expiring soon.  Get this paperwork submitted by February because you’ll otherwise forget about it & then have to pay extra fees for express handling at the last minute ($$).",2022-12-18 05:47:37

I found my luggages.

Let me give a background to help put better perspective.

On December 15, 2022 at 12:55pm PT, I boarded the bus from Los Angeles to Oklahoma City with my luggages tagged. We arrived Phoenix, Arizona and transferred to another bus by 9:40pm MST (This was my first time transferring, I honestly did not realize I had to move my two boxes to the other bus, technically, my luggages were still in the first bus as I never touched it.)

Upon arriving OKC, I realized the ugly reality. Rushed to the information center of the OKC station. The attendant casually told me to call Phoenix station, and asked me to check Google for the contact.

I’m not going to lie, after filing the claim, I dialed the number countless times, and I kept being returned to the Booking department and they were very much helpless as they could not do much as they were not in the station physically; some customer service specialist even suggested I return to Phoenix, that was some news that put some anxiety on me, the fact I would even return was not a guarantee I will find my luggages.

After much persistence, I was able to get a direct contact at the Phoenix station in the Baggages Department, it must have been some grace of sort, as one customer service specialist provided me with the contact after asking for permission. Although, the Baggages department told me they could not find my luggages at the station on three different attempts, they could not tell me whether it was already on the next bus. It was not inspiring, honestly.

However, intuitively, on December 16, 2022, I decided to monitor the next bus coming down to OKC from Phoenix, not out of certainty but just to utilize all options. I got to the station after its arrival and found my luggages there on December 17, 2022 by 11:30 am CST. All items were intact, and nothing had been tampered with. Got my bags and left.

Recommendations:

Ensure luggages are tagged at the first point of departure.

Contact the last station you think the luggage was lost. Although, you can go to the station too.

Look out for the next bus, it might just be on it. Also, understand that I never removed my box or put it in the park and forgot it. It was still on the bus, so, this may have been some factor.

I am sorry that others have not found theirs, I am hopeful that you will🙏🏾.

I got to the station after its arrival and found my luggages there. All items were intact, and nothing had been tampered with. Got my bags and left.

Recommendation:

1. Ensure luggages are tagged at the first point of departure.

2. Contact the last station you think the luggage was lost. Although, you can go to the station too.

3. Look out for the next bus, it might just be on it. Also, understand that I never removed my box or put it in the park and forgot it. It was still on the bus, so, this may have been some factor.

I am sorry that others have not found theirs, I am hopeful that you will🙏🏾.

Thank you",2022-12-18 05:23:44

If I had it my way I would be gym shorts, t shirt, jandals (flip flops for you non New Zealand folks...) all the way through. My wife is a little more respectable than me and makes me 'dress the part' when in public.

That being said, I'll be dress shorts and polo shirt in the lounge and boarding, then change into gym shorts and t shirt for the flights themselves. I also think it feels good to change back into 'nicer' clothes getting off the plane, meeting relatives, transiting to hotel or the likes.

You have the classic tourist spots like ephesus and cappadocia, and lots of lesser know hidden gems. The landscape diversity is wild, temperate rainforests in the North (Trabzon/Rize), steppe grasslands and high mountains in the east, desert in the south east, and subtropical environments in the south (Antalya and Muğla).

i loved just exploring around and meeting people, everyone in greece was just so lovely and friendly. be mindful when picking your hotel or airbnb however because we chose to stay in malia but it gets a bit crazy at night, lots of parties and drunk people, which is totally cool if thats your scene but it can be a bit much.

we were pretty out of the way, id totally recommend yiannis mannos hotel if youre looking for a quiet and scenic place to stay. it was pretty cheap to stay in, the rooms werent much but they were very clean. the pools were lovely, the staff are amazing there, they just absolutely cant do enough for you. the foods amazing aswell. as i said its pretty out of the way of everything , so you need to walk into town but the route is so charming, theres a chicken farm right next to it, and a lovely little family owned greek restaurant. theres lots of places to rent a car or bike nearby if youd like to drive around too

Comment,1,j0nud7w,,0,1671329517.0,"Lufthansa first is a step above any business class I've ever flown. They even great your dog by its name. 

You get escorted from check in to security. There you have a private room to take off your jacket and an employee carries your bin. From the private room, they take you to the front of the security line. Then they escort you to a special lounge where food and service are excellent. Then you get escorted to the plane so you don't have to wait in line with all the  business class low lives. 

At night, they add a mattress pad to your seat (though I believe Emirates does that even in business class). Food is really good, I have no idea how they manage that in the air. 

I think they have like 2 flight attendants for the 4 1st class seats, so service is excellent. Not like business where you have to get your own snacks and often don't get a drink during boarding. 

Emirates business picks you up at home, I don't think Lufthansa first has that service included.

Nobody cares what you wear. People just want to sleep and get home. Not show off or judge. 

Only problem is that Lufthansa first is not available on most airports (and most plane configurations). 

IMO it's totally worth it if you fly very regularly and you're bored/annoyed/tired of business class. If you've never flown business, business is probably exciting enough.",2022-12-18 04:11:57

Car to Ollytaytambo -> train to Aguas Caliante and back to Cusco.

Just so hard not to try and go everywhere but transportation/packing/unpacking sucks.

I suggest staying in Barranco over Mira Flores in Lima if you like the artsy and tbh recently ""gentrified"" scene. But it's so cute lolol

Spend more time in Cusco than Lima.
We organized our travel ourselves.  Might be worth it to go through a tour company for Macchu Picchu because it was a bit confusing organizing everything for us.  Definitely get a tour guide for Macchu!  We learned so much about it and appreciate it more than we would have without one.

If I remember correctly - for the real ID you needed a valid driver's license (so don't let yours ever expire), a birth certificate, a social security card, and two different pieces of mail with your name and address on it.

Comment,7,j0nlh9d,,0,1671325189.0,"A few things:  

For first / business class the airline and plane type matters.  If you are flying on United, it might be a 757, which is not as sexy as flying in a large widebody.  

From where you are flying from, the lounges can be extremely nice, and you could have a very tasty meal / drink before leaving.  You must find a Polaris lounge.  

IF you are flying from the East Coast, flight might be really short, and not able to enjoy the lie flats.  

First class is a dying breed.  I know BA has it still.  The Lufthansa first class experience is legendary, with their own ""terminal"" at Frankfurt.  But I wouldn't get 3 hours of happiness of flying that far.

Comment,3,j0n8ckl,,0,1671319091.0,"I recently flew business class with KLM from DC to UK. The lay flat seats made a big difference. There was no first class option on that flight. I think if you have the option of first class you should go for it for the bucket list.

As for clothing, everyone was smart casual (jeans/trousers/t-shirt/jumper). The majority changed in the bathroom after the meal service into comfier sleeping clothes. You usually get a little bag of toiletries and a face mask for settling down to sleep. I still take my own ear plugs, face mask and pillow to guarantee sleep.

Comment,1,j0n7shd,,0,1671318835.0,"Hi, we didn't hire we ended up using our own manual wheelchair and had a hire car. Happy to answer any specific questions but in general.

Verona was fantastic lots of the city accessible and easy to get around as flat mostly.

Buses were great to get for short journeys.

Venice was possible however you are restricted with not many bridges offering alternatives to steps. You can use the water buses however there is a step on and off but staff assisted.

Lake Garda was generally good where we visited.

The biggest consideration is those who are pushing and hot temperatures. Because we went in height of summer temperatures were around 35-40 degrees. It was best visiting during mornings and on evenings when temperatures were cooler. Have plenty of water on you and sun cream.

The differentiation really comes down to exclusivity and personalization. Business class is a large cabin and on most airline’s service will still feel pretty assembly line and impersonal. In first, there will be at most a handful of other people and you’ll feel much more individually looked after. Of course, the food, drink, and amenities are nicer too

Apart from individual variability, what counts is how high you go and 'how' you get to that altitude. A 'hike in Switzerland' or 'go to Bhutan' is absolutely meaningless info. The general advise is to climb slow. That is increase your sleeping altitude no more than 300m a day when above 2500m altitude and have a regular acclimatization day. Reality is of course far more complex and though you should certainly listen to your body, be aware that altitude sickness takes time to develop. So feeling ok, doesn't mean you can push on.

Comment,2,j0n4fw5,,0,1671317325.0,"Depending on where you are going you can choose your international flight to have a longer layover as a buffer or hedge against delays. AC does 2-3x daily to LHR, FRA and other international hubs for example. If you can't get the AC search engine to give you a longer layover you can sometimes get more connection options in a google flights search then click through to book directly with AC, or as a last resort you can call in and book over the phone, feeding the agent flight-by-flight for what you want.

Weather is a real risk, not sure if that helps you decide. Flights into Bangor could just as easily be delayed (or affected by weather at the hub the plane is coming from). It's generally true that you need to watch weather as you get into last 2-3 days. Usually you can rebook for free so consider if you have the flexibility to leave a day earlier or later if you happen to get a storm in the forecast as you get down to t-2. Better to rebook and have predictability than roll the dice and have to take a hotel unplanned. No airline will put you up if an airport shuts down for weather. 

AC does have delays or cancellations for other reasons but I don't think they are more or less common than any other airline. 

There are relatively few flights into Freddy (meaning delays are measured in days not hours), but again, unless you're driving to Boston it's probably a similar trade-off either way.",2022-12-18 00:48:45

I like to go to the smaller border crossings to do the immigration/customs paperwork, they tend to be faster, less crowded, and the agents are less stressed out.  Have a very warm blanket, there is always the chance you get stuck on the road for a couple of hours due to a closure or accident -- there are not too many alternate routes in some areas.  Take at least $100 ($1, 5, 10) in smaller denominations for tips or buying small things.  Don't worry about taking a lot of cash, you can get cash from ATMs, it's not worth it going to exchange places.  You can't really use credit cards at gas stations, and if you do use a card, have them bring the card reader to you - don't let the card out of your sight.

I was not sure if there was regulations around that or not that I should be aware of. Just like me crossing to do shopping because it's cheaper sometimes, but anything over 200$ in less than 48hours has to be claimed at customs.",2022-12-18 00:34:26

Comment,2,j0n0814,,0,1671315453.0,"We are more than a decade older and had not done international travel, which made no sense as everyone we know, even our own now young adult kids had traveled internationally. We intended to start traveling in the spring of 2020 - but of course, everything was canceled. Finally, in mid-2022 we did our first trip to Europe - we chose the Netherlands, for various reasons, spent two weeks there, traveling entirely on our own. Loved the country and the people and would visit there again. For a firsttime traveler, it was helpful that most of the people we interacted with spoke at least some English (English is widely used in the Netherlands). I have some skill in a couple of other languages but not Dutch!

Things I learned with our first trip: I did massive amounts of independent research and prep and planning, which turned out to have been super helpful. But awfully time consuming. But having a set of options pre-planned for each day was great when weather was bad or a museum was temporarily closed.

On our next trip, I probably will not do quite as much planning as I did for the first one. We are now looking at a 2023 trip and are starting our plan by picking a rough time frame and then our flights first, and then adjusting our planned itinerary to fit the flights. We found big pricing differences just moving the start and end dates from days to a couple of weeks.  I recently planned out another trip in detail - only to find we'd have to shift our trip weeks forward, airfares were way higher than expected and many flight options were already booked! We ended up putting this plan aside for another year as we couldn't make it work for us. But I learned a good lesson on that: figure out the flights first!

Am now also using others' suggested itineraries as a starting point and then reading up on venues, attractions, events, locations using online web stuff. Have found Rick Steves' books to be helpful for us and recommend them as one of many resources.",2022-12-18 00:17:33

Comment,2,j0mrpkb,,0,1671311842.0,"I own there and have for many years.  If my spouse comes with me we always take the owners update (aka sales pitch) and tell them up front that we're just showing up for the incentive (visa card, vouchers, points, etc) and then just keep saying no.  They're always polite, not too pushy and most times get you out on time.   It'll also work just fine for the deal you accepted.  The Resort is in  a great spot of the hotel zone with a small mall and restaurants across the street and grocery store a couple big blocks away.  Bus pickup right out front makes it easy to venture further into downtown (Walmart run).   Pool areas are nice and service is great.  Most of the times I use their concierge for tours but sometimes can find a much better deal online and book it directly.

Btw I think they meant these: https://www.nationalparks.fi/huts

> The most common and well-known type of free, open huts are the open wilderness huts. The wilderness huts are meant for one-night stays. They are usually located in the northern and eastern parts of Finland, usually in roadless backwoods. Other open huts include day trip huts, which are not meant for staying overnight. Also open turf huts and **campfire huts** are suitable places to stop and rest during the day, but in exceptional circumstances they can provide shelter for the night, too.

Of course, if someone isn't a fan of trying new foods, Iceland won't be the best choice. There are zero McDonald's and zero Starbucks in Iceland. There are Subways, Domino's and KFC for the person with an unadventurous palate.
We didn't just happen upon excellent food/restaurants in Iceland. We looked on Google, found reviews and menus that sounded interesting. Checked out recommendations from locals as well.

> Would my claim for a refund stand a good chance?

No.

> Should this be a valid reason for cancellation for travel insurance?

Read your policy first - coups/political unrest/protests/terrorism are typically excluded from a covered reasons.

So you, the customer, decided to cancel (by your initiative) instead of letting the airline/tour operator/etc cancel on you, means that you won't get any refund or credit if that's what the terms were.

Lima is fully operational and was never shut down. International flights operated the entire week.",2022-12-17 21:57:19

Comment,1,j0mdomp,,0,1671305884.0,"If your flight has a delay causing misconnection please call in advance in order for the airline to offer a comfortable solution for you.

As a general advice when booking a flight with a connection pls mind that

\- in winter times delays are perfectly acceptable (everyone's safety is of outmost importance) - as far as I know the EU regulation for compensation does not cover for cancellations and delays caused by weather conditions (I might be wrong - I not an expert here)

\- pls mind in what airport you are transferring (airports like LHR, FRA, DXB etc are huge - give yourself enough time to walk)

\- pls check if a passport check will be required (transferring in FRA you need to know if you are transferring from a non-schengen flight to a schengen flight as additional documents check by immigration is mandatory)

\- pls pay attention at gates and transfer signs - in case of doubt ask someone who is wearing an airline tag or uniform

\- give yourself time to transfer - especially if you are not a frequent flyer or if you are bad with directions. Better wait on a chair than to run through the airport and lose your flight.

&#x200B;

Also - pls check if the airline has some local phone numbers you can contact. Some airlines have hotlines for specific countries so they can help their passengers even more swiftly. Avoid calling USA, Germany (especially for LH), UK phone numbers as there are more ppl flying from there and the waiting time can be quite big, unless you are flying from there.",2022-12-17 21:38:04

Do note, it is chilly here in January! While you can still enjoy the beautiful coastal views, the water will be frigid. Check our Sunset Cliffs one evening!

In Northern Europe, Norway is maybe the most amazing country. But sometimes it’s raining there for three weeks continuously, also in summer. 

In western Europe I like France very much, but it is expensive and people are not the nicest on earth if you speak English and not French. Food is incredible there (best in Europe) and the scenery, too.

When I read your text, northern Italy came to mind. Tuscany is full of ancient towns and food is incredible there, too. At the northern part of Lake Garda, mountains meet a great lake. There are hundreds of hiking trails and if you go in June, the northern part is not so crowded. Further in the north, you will find the Dolomites, you can go hiking there for years and the scenery with the mountains and lakes is marvelous.

Portugal and Greece are rather recommendable for swimming holidays. Of course Spain is great, too. France and Spain are the most crowded countries in Europe, especially in July/August.",2022-12-17 20:42:29

Comment,3,j0m45ql,,0,1671301970.0,"I’m not living in Argentina for the moment but I’m argentinian, so I think I can help you…

The “Dollar Blue” is the unofficial rate, which is twice as high as the official rate imposed by the government.

In other words, if you exchange your dollars in an official exchange house or pay with a credit card, those dollars will be worth twice less in pesos than if you exchange them unofficially.

For the latter, you must have your money in cash and exchange it in person with someone once in Argentina.

Either individuals or unofficial exchange houses that you will find in ‘la city porteña’ of Buenos Aires, it is easy to find people who want dollars and will exchange them for you at the blue rate (by searching ""Cotización dollar blue Argentina"" in google you will be able to find out how much the rate is that day).

I hope the information helps you.

Have fun in Argentina!",2022-12-17 20:32:50

We sat down and narrowed it down to Europe from the areas of the word then voted on the countries we were interested in. Factoring in the kids interests (beach, mountains) we came up with our plan! 

We went to northern Italy this fall. Avoided all the touristy stuff. Visited Genoa, a beachside town called Camogli. Then went to to Bolzano, saw Ötzi the iceman, then hiked Seceda. I’d you are outdoorsy people from Colorado I think you’ll *love* the Alps. We flew out of Innsbruck which is a super underrated but lovely European town with castes and typical European sightseeing that’s not crowded. Only shopping we did was for hiking boots. 

Food was amazing. Scenery mind blowing. People lovely. At the time we went, (early oct) not crowded at all. Whatever you choose I hope you like it!

Edit to add that the hike was not extreme (like North American hiking can be) so your daughter could totally do it. I’m 44, not super fit and asthmatic and I did it, just needed a bit longer to catch my breath when going uphill.

Comment,0,j0m2uco,,0,1671301436.0,"I feel this so much.

I backpacked around Europe in my 20's and caught the travel bug HARD. I never got to travel as much as I dreampt about it and still don't as much as I want even though I really have the means to do so.

But i spent a LOT of time dreaming and talking about it, to the point that people would get pissed at me for doing so. My parents, family, friends (who i still talk to) neighbors, wife, etc ALL think I am too obsessed with wanting to travel (specifically to Europe) and don't get why I care for very few other things beyond European travel. They don't understand why a lot of ""normal"" things don't instill the same passion as the thought and action of European travel does for me.

They don't get why domestic travel doesn't even give me that same feeling of excitement or why i'd rather spend money on traveling to Europe than redoing the kitchen or trading in my perfectly fine paid-off car for a new one with a new car payment.

But as I look and talk to each one I realize that not a single one of them, barring my father, has ever spent more than a traditional 1-2 week American vacation to anywhere outside the US or a tropical island. A few of my friends, and my wife, have spent 1-2 weeks in Europe. And I don't think any of them understands what happens when you spend an extended period of time traveling around a place where you are not pressured about being 'home' win 10-12 days.

20+ years later, I find I have very little to talk with to others, unless they have or want to travel and then I can go for hours. Over this time I have started and stopped and started again building a European travel app to help others plan trips and connect with other Europe travelers. I've started to interview other Europe travelers to provide inspiring stories to new and wannabe Eurotrippers, and really to satiate my own desire to talk European travel with others.

It can seem lonely to yourself, and weird to others who don't get it, but wanderlust runs deep and you really can only share it with others who have experienced it. That's why this community, and I hope the one I am building again, are really helpful.",2022-12-17 20:23:56

Stunning scenery - volcanoes, mountains, rivers, jungles, waterfalls, cloud forests, and amazing beaches. The number and different types of wildlife is amazing. Speaking some Spanish will really add to your trip, but you can get by just fine in Costa Rica without speaking any Spanish at all.

I was there in December and Pompeii (highly recommended!) was almost totally empty.

The Italian/Austrian high speed rail and sleeper train system also means that you can combine this with Central European Christmas markets if you like. For instance, you can take an overnight train from Vienna to Milan, Rome, Florence or Venice, and from there take a high speed train to Naples or an overnight train to Sicily.

An alternative to get into Italy is to take the Bernina Express through spectacular Alpine scenery from Chur, Switzerland to Tirano, Italy. From there you can take a regular Italian local train along the shore of Lake Como to Milan.

(When I did this I took the TGV from Paris to Zurich the evening before, spent a night in a hotel in Zurich then took an early morning local train to Chur)

Check later departures from Frankfurt to your onward destination on any airline, and make a note of the first 2-3 that leave an hour after you arrive.

When you get there, go to a Lufthansa service desk or agent - preferably the first one you can find - and ask what the rebooking options are. They *should* offer you something reasonable. They are obliged (EU regulation 261/2004 and relevant case law) to book you on the next available flight in similar travel conditions (i.e. same class of travel) or later if you choose. So if there is another airline leaving within a couple of hours with a seat in the same cabin you are booked in while the next LH flight is the next day, they should put you on that other airline.

Knowing the other flights ahead of time means you can specifically ask for them.

You could go and everything is fine or you could go and get stuck. It seems like the unrest is unlikely to stop, so I'd put a lot more thought into going or not.

Don’t dismiss South Africa, every story spread about our crime is countered by hundreds of thousands of visitors to our country who loved their African experience perfectly safely. Be savvy, avoid walking in dark areas in cities at night, like anywhere else in the  world. KNP offers Walking Safari’s with fully trained guides to ensure no negative animal encounters, of course you could self drive  or join a game drive on a park vehicle. A huge park with the Big Five and much more.

Comment,5,j0ldewj,,0,1671290538.0,"Hi! I’ve been to Japan a couple of times. I don’t speak Japanese but did just fine. Last time I was there was in 2019. In writing this response, I’d be using Tokyo as frame of reference.

Japan is extremely safe and transportation is efficient. There are English speaking volunteers at train stations who can assist you if you need help finding the right train stop. In case you get lost, Google maps would be of great help too.

Things could get a bit confusing if it’s your first time in Japan, but don’t fret. More and more Japanese are becoming comfortable speaking in English, especially in touristy areas. You’ll find lots of foreigners/expats there who’d be willing to help you out.

When dining, you can use Google translate to read menus without English translations. Don’t worry though, a lot of restaurants have simple menus with photos and descriptions in English.

Tokyo is a busy city but you’ll find a lot of wonderful parks and other quiet places there like gardens and temples.

Osaka is worth visiting. It’s slower than Tokyo but it has a lot to offer like museums and charming neighborhoods.

Kyoto feels like old Japan. Here you can experience tea ceremonies and you’ll find lots of interesting artisan shops.

Nagano is underrated but definitely visit if you want to see snow monkeys. You can hike in Mt. Togakushi and be surrounded by giant cedar trees. It’s one of my favorite places in Japan.

I’ve never tried renting cars in Japan, but managed to get by just by taking trains and buses.

Comment,1,j0la4pf,,0,1671288981.0,"In Lisbon, make a trip to the Time Out Market - it is a food hall with a good variety of food and some of the best chefs have stalls there. 

And a must-eat are the delicious pastel de nata (custard tarts). They are found at any bakery but a trip to the original Pasteis de Belem is worth it.",2022-12-17 16:56:21
Comment,1,j0la1m3,,0,1671288939.0,Thailand is amazing. I was just there with my ten year old son. 5 yummy Thai dishes $10. 1 hour hot coconut oil massage $10. Friendly people. Beautiful beaches. Jungle and Island action.,2022-12-17 16:55:39
Comment,0,j0l9xf1,,0,1671288881.0,"They are all amazing and deserve more time. However, I prefer Venice to Florence. Venice is great just to wander around. Florence to me is more about the museums. Venice has no cars and that’s magical. no place like it.",2022-12-17 16:54:41
Comment,1,j0l9vnp,,0,1671288857.0,"If you tried disputing with your credit card, they will not rule in your favor. Fat fingering isn't the vendor's fault.

But, my experience with online third parties for hotels isn't as difficult or awful as for airlines.

But it all depends on the cancellation/refund policy of your booking.

If you're only due half, then that's what you'll get.",2022-12-17 16:54:17
Comment,12,j0l9ue6,,0,1671288840.0,"I do it plenty. I take 25-30+ hour trips all the time. But, make sure you buy a water bottle and not use the sink water. I also change clothes in the bathroom.

Comment,1,j0l9stb,,0,1671288818.0,"That area looks so pretty. Maybe 4 in Madrid, then off to Andalusia for the rest? I'd like to kick around at one of the beach towns one day just to see the Med. Was thinking of Gibraltar to see the rock then explore the coast.   


Why not Madrid and Valencia? MAD is where we fly into, I would be down with starting and ending there with some free time to kick around town so we're not too far from the airport when it's time to head back to the US.",2022-12-17 16:53:38
Comment,3,j0l9qkf,,0,1671288788.0,"Toronto had severe staffing issues in second half of 2022. That was the airport itself as much as Air Canada.

I'm an Air Canada frequent flier and I've connected through YYZ at least once a month all year. It's not quite as bad as the previous comment suggests, but it is a real concern.  It was worst in July-August, much better now.

Definitely look at all your options, but your idea is solid.",2022-12-17 16:53:08
Comment,12,j0l9mod,,0,1671288736.0,"I lookup the coins and bills (when there is no numbers) on wiki or Google and print out a color copy with info on the value, so I understand better.

And as to the response here, this question is unfortunately....very very ignorant.  Like ""I'm a troll pressing your buttons"" ignorant.  And lacks an empathy for the other person in the scenario.  If you cannot imagine going WTF and refusing weird foreign currency for yourself if you were in this situation then the question lacks any common sense.",2022-12-17 16:52:16

Comment,2,j0l9188,,0,1671288443.0,"Been there twice, once in Durban and once in Jo’burg, both for military medicine (tropical disease) partnerships.  Very beautiful country and some genuinely nice people, but I was appalled at the climate of hate that hangs over so much of the country. You absolutely cannot trust anyone in a business agreement and business contracts are largely unenforceable, especially if you’re the non-SA partner.  It is a failed state that continues to get propped up by foreign entities who are pillaging the natural resources.  

The rate at which young South Africans are leaving the country is a good indicator.  There’s nothing for them there.",2022-12-17 16:47:23
Comment,2,j0l8xwm,,0,1671288398.0,"IMO New Zealand is too far for only 10-12 days. I have been to Taiwan twice and love it (not everyone does though). Taipei is a great city with wonderful food. Public transit is clean and easy. Also recommend Tainan for interesting history and a very different feel from Taipei. There is a surprising amount of nature and mountains with lovely hiking. Taipei is an expensive city, but outside of Taipei the prices are more reasonable. Outside of Taipei, there are definitely fewer English speakers but Google translate helps! My other choice would be Chile - Santiago is a fun city and there are endless possibilities outside Santiago (Valparaiso, wine region, Patagonia). It is a huge country so you can't do it all in one trip. But if you have time and budget, I would highly recommend taking 2-3 days to go to Rapa Nui (Easter Island), one of the most fascinating places and technically part of Chile so it is a domestic flight. It is a long flight but LATAM flies a comfortable 787 daily from Santiago. Our Spanish is very rudimentary but we had no issues in Chile.",2022-12-17 16:46:38
