I'm 33 traveling with my wife 31. Ive been to Europe a few times but have spent very little time in Spain. I'm meeting some friends for Oktoberfest in Munich next year at the end of September. Here's the plan so far. 15 nights. 

-	Flight into Munich for 3 nights 
-	Flight to Madrid to spend 3 nights 
-	Granada for 2 nights (I've heard great things but I'm torn between Granda and Seville? Are these two similar? 
-	Flight to Mallorca to spend 3 nights. I'd love to see a beautiful Mediterranean island in Spain. 
-	Flight to Barcelona for 4 nights and fly home from here. 

Sincerely would love your feedback. We both love Tuscan cities and would both lean toward charming towns and cities with beautiful history over more modern architecture. Both love great food and good drinks. I'm so excited to spend time with Spanish culture I've heard the people are wonderful.",2022-12-18 05:20:52

Background: I am not an avid traveler and with my commitments, I barely get time to travel. Since I have never been to South America, I decided to travel to Chile for a week over Christmas. Here is what I have planned so far. I can always extend my trip for a day or two if you guys think it‚Äôs too ambitious. And I can cut back on activities as well.

Day 1: Arrive in Santiago and explore the city
Day 2: Bus to Valparaiso, explore the city, and then back to Santiago
Day 3: Flight to Calama and then shuttle to San Pedro de Atacama. Catch the sunset at Moon Valley and then night stay at San Pedro de Atacama.
Day 4: Early start - Tatio Geysers, then Puritama hot springs. Rest for a couple of hours. Tour out to Laguna Chaxa + Laguna Tebinquinche.
Day 5: Flight from Calama to Punta Arenas. Speed boat to Magdalena Island. Bus to Puerto Natales.
Day 6: Estancia La Peninsula (one day tour) + dinner at the Singular Patagonia.
Day 7: Rental Car to Torres Del Paine. 1 day hike up to the three towers. Drive back to Puerto Natales and rest for the night.
Day 8: flight to santiago and then back home.

Also, if you guys have any experience with Moon Valley, how did you get there? I am seeing horseback tours that are 5 hours but there aren‚Äôt too many details online. Also is it possible to get a guide or join a tour for that trek in Torres del Paine? I am okay going solo everywhere but I think a tour guide might be really helpful for this hike.

Party / sightseeing trip in Europe starting in Copenhagen and finishing in Budapest... but need help deciding where to between Berlin and Prague for 5 days?,0,zo918o,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zo918o/party_sightseeing_trip_in_europe_starting_in/,5,1671292005.0,"Hi! I‚Äôm planning a big party / sightseeing trip that will be starting in Copenhagen and finishing off in Budapest.

1. Copenhagen 3 nights

2. Hamburg 3 nights

3. Berlin 5 nights

4. *unknown* 5 nights

5. Prague 3 nights

6. Bratislava 2 nights (Bratislava instead of Vienna because Vienna apparently isn‚Äôt a good party city at al and Wild Elephants Hostel in Bratislava is supposed to be a top party hostel)

7. Budapest 4 nights

For the 5 unknown nights I have three options in mind:

Option 1: after Berlin train to Warsaw (2 nights), and then train to Krakow (3 nights). And then flight to Prague from Krakow. (But I don‚Äôt ideally want the stress of getting flights to and from destinations on this itinerary. But Krakow and Warsaw appear to be like really fun party cities with very interesting history.)

Option 2: After Berlin, 2 nights in Leipzig and then 3 nights in Munich, then off to Prague. But are Leipzig and Munich the party destinations I‚Äôm looking for? It appears not, but I would love to try some Munich beer!

Option 3: Add some extra days onto cities already on the list for day trips. Perhaps 2 extra nights to Prague for day trips to both Dresden and Pilsen? Perhaps and extra day onto Bratislava for a day trip to Vienna? Maybe an extra night in Berlin? Not too sure

Some context: Will be flying out of Houston and would have to leave AFTER Christmas to spend time with family and get back at or before January 7th.

Do you struggle to explain your fascination with travel?,12,zo179d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zo179d/do_you_struggle_to_explain_your_fascination_with/,38,1671263152.0,"Delete if not allowed. 

So few years ago I decided to invest my free time and money into travel as i got obsessed with it, guess I caught the travel bug.

I stopped buying so many clothes as I had so many I couldn‚Äôt shut my wardrobe, latest video games or gadgets that I would play with for couple of hours and never again and being lucky enough to live in London and have access to budget airlines I go travelling on short 2-3 day breaks once a month. 

Every time I try and explain my passion for travel to people and the fact that I go away once a month just baffles people to the point that they just think am weird. 

I had someone tell me they‚Äôre so well travelled because they‚Äôve been to Italy 12 times and also once to Greece, Spain and Portugal where as I‚Äôve hit 50 countries. 

Obviously online you read travel blogs and can have discussions with like minded people, but just wondering if anyone who is well travelled like this ever faced that problem, or is there actually a point where someone saying that you‚Äôre weird for getting into this obsession warranted. Even my own parents don‚Äôt get it.

EDIT: I think the question stems from the fact that because almost all of my free time is invested in planning travel or travelling, a lot of my general conversations are either small talk or turn into a travel story and i am struggling to find people in real life as opposed to someone on TikTok who understand that kick for travelling.",2022-12-17 09:45:52

Getting a refund from Travelocity: How dumb am I?,2,zo09mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zo09mn/getting_a_refund_from_travelocity_how_dumb_am_i/,4,1671259458.0,"Reading through this sub, it seems like the answer I'm gonna get is ""Don't book with 3rd party sites"", which now seems like good advice that I'll heed for the rest of my days.

I booked a room with Travelocity and absentmindedly selected the wrong days. I just chose the 2 nearest dates (it's the middle of the night, so in my head the day is over) not realizing I was booking for \*right now\*, and should have been booking for tomorrow and the next day.

In my confirmation email it showed the day of the week, which clued me in, so I immediately called the hotel thinking maybe we could just let the payment for 2 nights stand, and have them mark the correct dates in their system. The woman on the phone was nice, but requested I try canceling through Travelocity first. When I clicked the ""cancel"" button, I was pleasantly surprised to see $435 (the full amount) shown as my refund amount. I thanked her, said it was taken care of, hung up, and accepted the cancellation and refund.

Unfortunately on the next page, the amount changed, now showing $217.96, only half a refund. So after a back and forth between the hotel and Travelocity, there's no resolution and I was told to wait 72 hours for my support ticket to be answered.

So I guess my question here: Does anyone have a similar experience, and were you able to get a refund? Tried disputing with credit card? (I used my Chase Unlimited, probably not the best). Anything else I should be doing? Thanks! $217 just seems a bit steep for a mis-click.",2022-12-17 08:44:18

Post Corona Traveling in Western Countries,1,znxn7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/znxn7h/post_corona_traveling_in_western_countries/,9,1671249896.0,"
Hey guys,

I‚Äòm currently in Australia.
I‚Äòve been saving up for what was supposed to be a 2 year long journey for 3 years now and I was really excited for it. 

Now that I‚Äòm here, I feel like it was a terrible decision and I should‚Äòve waited a couple more years for things to maybe cool down. 
Let me explain:

I am aware that December is the most expensive month for travelers since it‚Äòs the start of summer around here, but the prices are absolutely insane.
I‚Äòm lucky enough to have found a place where I can house sit for three weeks, but besides that, I‚Äôm having a tough time finding accommodation. I either pay 40‚Ç¨ a night for a hostel room that I share with 9 other people or I pay 10‚Ç¨ more to have an AirBnB to myself. 

While I usually really like hostels because they have a great vibe and I always meet awesome people there, for that amount of money, the choice is pretty clear. I spend almost the same amount and have a kitchen, bathroom and a King sized bed all to myself. And I can also sleep better, knowing that my belongings won‚Äôt be stolen. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, in Central and South America I‚Äôd always choose hostels over everything. 7-15‚Ç¨ for one night? Amazing! 
But this is the same reason why I currently regret not going there instead.
I was hoping to buy a car here in which I could sleep at least but no chance. 

Lastly I‚Äôm also having a tough time making friends here. While Aussies seem friendly and chatty at first, they just become uninterested very quickly. It‚Äôs always the same. Someone approaches me or vice versa, we exchange a few sentences and that‚Äôs about it. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, maybe that‚Äôs just the norm around here but I‚Äôve never had that happen to me in any other country before.
I would always start talking to someone and we‚Äôd end up walking through the city for hours, getting some food and drinks and then exchange numbers. Not here tough.
Is that normal? Should I change something about myself?

What are your experiences? Should I just try to enjoy some months here and then move the trip to some other time before I waste too much of my savings? Because at the moment, the guilt of paying so much is just higher than the joy I get out of anything here. 

Cheers!",2022-12-17 06:04:56

Halfway down in a remote part of Baja, I started to feel woozy/sick so stopped at a hotel for the night. The next day I got violently ill. I‚Äôm really not sure if it was food poisoning or what, but I puked for like 24hrs straight and coincidentally the area was hit by a hurricane at the same time. I told the hotel desk I might need to get to a hospital and was told all the roads had been washed away by the hurricane. This really freaked me out as I was starting to get concerned about dehydration and malnourishment (still could barely keep anything down) and I ended up laid up in bed for another two days waiting for the road repairs. I remained so feeble I could hardly walk around.

Eventually I got out but the trip back up felt like a fight for survival. I was constantly experiencing spells of hypertension, wooziness, cold sweats etc. In the months since I have continued to have strong physical symptoms and my doctors are basically telling me these are symptoms of anxiety. It‚Äôs possible I suppose and I wonder if what I experienced was a sort of panic attack.

Never in a million fucking years would I have imagined something like this would happen to me. I am a seasoned motorcyclist and third world solo traveler. I went into that trip with so much confidence and excitement and since then, I feel afraid to even go on particularly long drives from my house. Any sort of trip that would take me to a place where I couldn‚Äôt be immediately whisked away to a hospital makes me feel nervous.

It‚Äôs marked a turning point in my desire to travel and I just feel so discouraged. I can‚Äôt tell you how much of a departure my current mentality is from how I felt before that trip- I am (was?) a really adventurous person who always jumped into new experiences with both feet. I‚Äôve done intense trips like that many times before and even when things went terribly wrong I was always the one everybody relied on to take it all with a laugh and a smile.

I had been saving up for a long time to travel around the world which has been a dream of mine since I was little. Now I can‚Äôt even imagine doing so.

I guess I‚Äôm just venting or wondering if anybody has had similar experiences or advice.",2022-12-17 03:30:53

Log cabins,1,znu7e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/znu7e9/log_cabins/,2,1671238731.0,"
Hi all!

I am trying to plan a trip for my father‚Äôs 70th birthday. I need help because while I know what I want, I don‚Äôt know where I want.

I want to rent a log cabin for my dad. For whatever reason he just loves log cabins. I also think he‚Äôd like to enjoy the cool mountains and take a break from golf courses and the hot, hot Florida heat. I will also rent a car. 

Having a little town near by would be nice so we can go out to eat and peruse little shops. Other attractions near by would be a bonus. While we all appreciate the outdoors, none of us are hikers. It‚Äôs more about the scenery. We would consider day activities.

There must be major airport close by. Four people will be flying in from three cities and I‚Äôd like us all to have direct  flights. The smallest airport we will be flying in from is RSW. 

I‚Äôd like the cabin to be within a 40-minute drive. While I‚Äôll rent a car, I don‚Äôt want to have to drive another 3+ hours from the airport to get to the cabin.

Timeframe - 5 days in March or April 

I‚Äôm open as far as destinations in the US. And if it‚Äôs not in a mountain or not super cool temp that‚Äôs okay too. Just somewhere that feels more rustic. I would really like to stick with a log cabin if possible. But if not, a place where we can just have a good time and enjoy a little bit of the outdoors. Ideas that sound about right to based on only things I have heard from others: Broken Bow, OK; Colorado; Dollywood; Tennessee‚Ä¶ not sure about logistics though. 

Any ideas greatly welcomed - thanks!",2022-12-17 02:58:51

My husband, teenage daughter, and I live in Colorado. We've never traveled internationally, just throughout the U.S.  It's incredible to me considering that my husband and I are a half-century old that we've never done it. We are thinking of taking a 2-week trip this next year, early summer, and are having an *exceptionally* hard time deciding where in THE WORLD to go. My husband and I are outdoorsy, love nature, good food, biking, hiking and can't tolerate crowds or shopping. We aren't into big cities and prefer less populated, quaint areas. We love the sea for viewing, not swimming or snorkling. A nice bike path by the sea, hiking, quaint/interesting towns/villages with excellent food would be heaven to us. (No cruises!) My teenage daughter is not so outdoorsy, but won't complain about biking/hiking if we keep it casual. She loves the sea. Good food. Fun activites for a teen. She's artsy.  We've talked about Ireland, the Meditterean Sea, Thailand (the flight time - good lord, but man do I want to visit!), or just doing the Vancouver/Vancouver Island trip we'd had planned for May of 2020 but had to cancel because of the pandemic. I've been reading the r/travel posts for a short while now and I'm completely envious of all the folks who are able to travel regulary (or internationally at all, really). We don't know where to start and this may be the only international trip we take with our daughter before she heads off to college. (We *might* be able to sqeeze in two trips.) We've got to make it good - super memorable and worth the money. If anyone has any thoughts, we'd greatly appreciate the input. Thanks!!!

I am planning on visiting Amsterdam sometime in April 2023. My group will be visiting for probably 4 days max (including a day trip to the Keukenhof gardens to see the tulips). We have a total of 8-9 days allotted for the trip and were hoping to visit another place in Europe for the remaining few days. Our main interests are general sightseeing/history, food (although not snobbish about this), shopping, and people watching. Love walkable areas and squares with stores and coffee shops/restaurants. Accessibility from Amsterdam by train is preferred but we are okay with flying if needed. We have been to Paris a couple times so would prefer to avoid it.

Some destination ideas to pair with our Amsterdam trip are:

* Copenhagen: seems similar to Amsterdam but more expensive (but okay with our budget). Wouldn't mind flying since it's a bit further away. Not sure if the weather will be worse since it's more north. 
* Belgium: honestly not my #1 choice but easy given the location. I would skip Brussels based on what I've read and focus on Ghent, Bruges, and maybe Antwerp(?).
* Stay in Netherlands and check out nearby areas such as Utrecht
* Western Germany: Hamburg (with day trip to Bremen)? Other German place? We've been to Munich already and are saving Berlin for a later trip
* London: feel neutral about this since I was recently there not too long ago

Without rehashing the multiple transfers to increasingly incompetent customer service agents, the call being sent to a customer service satisfaction survey prior to the transaction being completed, the repeated calls to the American Airlines credit card helpline and general repeating of the increasingly frustrating story, I‚Äôll simply state my conclusion. 

If you pay using a credit card, the website and the customer service staff are polite, effective and efficient. 

If you are attempting to redeem miles the website is problematic and the customer service agents are less skilled. 

I‚Äôm confident that this is intentional and designed to frustrate the user into simply paying and not redeeming miles. It‚Äôs a fine example of weaponized incompetence. 

This will be my last flight with American. 

My plan is to use United. Does anyone have advice or experience with their mileage redemption process?",2022-12-17 00:16:24

In October, my wife and I were in Europe (Switzerland), and our flight back to the U.S. was canceled, and we were put on a new flight which left a day earlier than we planned. We had to cut our honeymoon a day short due to this change and we were not notified in any way. The only reason I found out at all was because I checked the app on a whim 3 days prior to our departure. 

We got home and I filed a claim with KLM/Delta requesting 600 Euros of compensation each, which is the entitlement under EC261.

They responded and said because we arrived back home without a technical delay (since we left a day early) we were only entitled to half the compensation at 300 euros each. 

Upon further reading, it seems like the CJEU ruled in 2021, that if the flight is brought forward by more than an hour, airlines cannot reduce the compensation on the grounds that we arrived home without a technical delay. I've quoted this section of the ruling back to KLM/Delta in our email communications and they're basically just ignoring me and responding back saying we are only owed 50% of the compensation without even addressing the court ruling at all.

How can I further pursue this? Usually, I'd let it go because it wasn't a huge inconvenience overall, but honestly, at this point, I'm annoyed enough to take the time to make it happen.

I don't want to use one of the companies that pursue claims like this (airhelp, etc) if I can avoid it, as they take a decent cut.

"Deciding whether to revisit Berlin, or to visit Dresden, or to visit Leipzig as my final destination on my Central Europe trip next year?",2,znb9wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/znb9wx/deciding_whether_to_revisit_berlin_or_to_visit/,3,1671185296.0,"I‚Äôm planning a trip through Europe next year around April/May time. 

So far the trip is:

Belgrade (3 nights)
Budapest (4 nights)
Bratislava (1 night)
Vienna (3 nights)
Prague (3 nights)
.... (2 nights remaining)

The two nights remaining could either be:

(A) Berlin (2 nights)
But I HAVE visited Berlin before a couple years back. I did enjoy Berlin at the time, but I do feel perhaps it was a little ‚Äútoo cool‚Äù for me. I feel like I‚Äôve visited all of the main attractions I wanted to see. I feel like the only reason for me to revisit would be to go visit the techno clubs, since I didn‚Äôt go to the last time. There‚Äôs no other reason massively drawing me back to Berlin, other than the parties/clubs and the cheap flight back home.

(B) 1 Night in Dresden + 1 night in Berlin. 
This option gives me the chance to check out Dresden - which looks like such a beautiful city. And the recent history of the city does interest me. Although I do like pretty / interesting archtecture, I‚Äôm not sure whether Dresden is worth the overnight stay. It does look small, so maybe a day trip from Prague is a better idea(?) 

(C) 1 Night in Leipzig + 1 night in Berlin. 
I hear that Leipzig is ‚Äúthe new Berlin‚Äù. So it could be a cool idea to visit Leipzig. I heard it‚Äôs a cool student city with good nightlife. Doesn‚Äôt appear as pretty as Dresden, but perhaps it is a more vibrant city. I do like vibrant cities.

(D) 1 night in Dresden + 1 night in Leipzig. 
I can get a flight back home from Leipzig (although more expensive than the Berlin flight). And this option gives me the chance to visit two new cities. But then again I miss out on revisiting Berlin.

Which option do you guys think is best for me?

My Interests: food, a buzz/vibrancy in the city, good nightlife, nice architecture, interesting recent history, good beer.",2022-12-16 12:08:16

My original intention was to play it by ear, but I am starting to feel a little scared that maybe we should plan a bit more our itnerary. 

For those who did a RTW, did you plan all your destinations before? Or did you go with the flow?

I was intending that we move from destination to destination. For example, if we feel like a beach we would find cheap tickets or buses to the destination. 

We also would love to spend 3 weeks to a month in a city and do day trips on the weekend since my fiance will be remote working. 

We are both burned out in a way so we also don't want to move alot.

Also, another problem: when I tried to apply for a state ID today, I found out that my current home address is written differently on several official documents. Each one has a variation of the same apartment number. So let's say my address is ""1234 Apple St Apt 1A."" Some documents have it as ""1234 Apple St Apt A"" and others have it as ""1234 A Apple St."" I couldn't proceed with the application process because the addresses on my parent's documents didn't match the one I wrote down; however, my main concern now is that I won't be able to get home if I don't report my current home address correctly.

My parents plan to bring a bunch of documents to prove that our address is written down differently a lot.

Our biggest priority is doing some low to moderate intensity day hikes in the Dolomites and also just getting to experience life in Northern Italy‚Äînone of us has been there before. 

We would like to spend a few days doing day hikes, maybe a few intermittent days of relaxing, and a few days of city life and going to museums. Generally we prefer depth over breadth. Not sure about:

1. Which cities to prioritize?
2. How many cities is too ambitious? Is there a set of cities that pair well with also being able to hike the Dolomites?
3. Is it better to have a ‚Äúhome base‚Äù and then commute out to a few cities with a rental car or to jump between hotels and use public transit? If there is a home base, which city would you recommend?
4. Any experiences using rental cars, ride share, or AirBNB in Northern Italy? Curious to hear your experiences.

Is 2 Days - 1 Night from Marrakech-Merzouga-Fes too rushed?,2,zmyjet,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zmyjet/is_2_days_1_night_from_marrakechmerzougafes_too/,3,1671143985.0,"***Slightly long post, but the summary questions are at the bottom!***

I'll be flying into Marrakech with my fiancee one Saturday evening in January, and flying out of Tangier the following Sunday (so 8 days in total).

Our main concern is that the 2 Day-1 Night Transport Tour from Marrakech to Fes, whilst fairly efficient travel-wise (as we'd be ""using"" a day anyway if we got the 7-8 hour train from Marrakech to Fes, but this way we at least get a desert visit in), might be too rushed and/or too long in the car/minivan??

Our draft itinerary looks like:

* Saturday: arrive late night into Marrakech
* Sunday: Marrakech
* Monday: Marrakech
* Tuesday: depart 7am on organised tour to Merzouga, stay overnight in desert
* Wednesday: depart Merzouga early morning with tour to get into Fes early evening
* Thursday: Fes
* Friday: Fes
* Saturday: depart Fes early morning to Chefchaouen 
* Sunday: depart Chefchaouen in the afternoon to get to Tangier to fly home that evening

So, I guess our questions are:

1. Are we better off doing the 3 Day-2 Night Marrakech>Merzouga>Fes tour? If the answer is yes, then are we better off 'taking' a day away from our 2 days in Marrakech or in Fes?
2. What's the transport like on the journey itself? And are there frequent stops?
3. Anything else glaringly wrong with this itinerary?

I‚Äôm not positive what to make of this situation. My wife are on a trip to one of the top hotels in Costa Rica (will leave out identifying details unless someone feels it‚Äôs relevant).  We just got back from the pool and noticed that our room was propped open. We immediately notified security who is pulling camera and door scans, and we‚Äôve checked all of our belongings. 

I‚Äôm unsure as to what might‚Äôve happened. We absolutely had house keeping come around 9am and we‚Äôre in the room ourselves around 11. We‚Äôve had turndown service around 6-7pm nightly, so I don‚Äôt believe it was that. 

With this being a relatively nice and expensive hotel, is it unrealistic to request a different room? Our privacy is now a concern for the final two nights of our trip. 

Any ideas or advised steps are appreciated. This is likely paranoia but perspectives are welcomed.

Edit: 
First, thank you to everyone that offered some helpful perspective. Specifically folks with experience in hospitality. I appreciate the validation of some of my initial concern. After a thorough look through of our items and the room nothing was out of place or irregular. 
We got some follow up from the hotel cameras and access reports. It seems that there was spot service that day from their room service team (separate from their housekeeping team) checking our mini bar and food supply. Some folks were missing one of the points I probably didn‚Äôt convey well enough, there was no clarification on how long our room was left open with the latch. My best guess was 1-4hours. 
The hotel did offer complimentary dinner as an apology which was a very nice gesture given it was a mistake. I plan to talk to the manager on duty before leaving tomorrow.

I was fortunate enough to snag incredibly cheap premium cabin flights landing in Munich and exiting from London Heathrow next week. However, I got them super last minute yesterday and I need to fill in an itinerary for 2. While this purchase was definitely made with my aviation geek brain, I do want to enjoy my time in Europe.

My partner and myself are primarily interested in the cuisine, be it fine dining or street food.  After that, it would be experiences to see historic sites, or enjoy the landscape.

I've never been to Europe before so this is some last minute research, staying up all night scouring this subreddit, youtube, google, etc.. I'd appreciate any help and suggestions! I'll update this post as I figure things out.

12/20 - Land in Munich at Noon.

12/21, 12/22, - Hofbrauhaus, Marienplatz, BMW tour. Attempting to get to Neuschwanstein Castle or Dachau.

Redacted:  ~~I really want to see a Christmas market, but there isn't much in Munich that attracts me. The Christmas Market in Frankfurt is definitely on the bucket list though. Debating on whether to get a hotel/hostel here and enjoying the City for at least one day, or going straight to Frankfurt. In a recent post, I read that Munich isn't really a multi-day city.~~

12/23 - Train to Cologne -> Hopefully catch the tail-end of the markets before they close down

12/24 - Cologne and take the train to Brussels -> London

12/25 - Christmas in London!

12/26 - Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, London Eye, Trafalgar Square, Tower of London

12/27 - Cambridge, Oxford, Brighton, or Salisbury & StoneHenge Tour? Anyone have recommendations/preferences here?

12/28 - Pray we can wake up at ~~5am~~ 3AM(?) to make it to Heathrow for a 9am flight

I'd also love some recommendations for things to do in each respective city beyond the usual tourist sites!

Edit 1: Debating staying for a day or 2. This would push Frankfurt for 12/22, 12/23.

Edit 2: Amsterdam/Paris seem way too rushed. Would rather do 5 days in Germany, 3 days in London. With the phenomenal feedback, we'll stay in Munich until 12/23 and head to Frankfurt then just to catch the bucketlist Christmas Market. 12/24 in Cologne, 12/25 morning figure out how we're getting to London

Edit 3: Definitely have to take into consideration the strikes in UK... Praying we can get onto our plane getting home!  


Edit 4: Market schedule reconsidered, cutting Frankfurt out altogether. Hopefully train travel through Brussels into London won't be impacted too heavily. ",2022-12-16 00:15:12

I like the fact that the stress of planning and knowing what routes to take will be taken off me.

There will be far less stress having a group around me and my parents who still worry about their 28 year old daughter will worry less..and I will also worry less about them worrying (yes I am this sad!).

We are a couple in the early 30s from Austria, so this time of the year can be quite cold why we want to fly somewhere warmer. Usually we do like to travel by car within the country and not by domestic plane (if possible). What we normally look for is to do something not too touristic like resorts, lots of beach days or guided tours only. We focus more on light hiking (day hikes not trekking), cities, culinary and nature. Also we like to keep our it itinerary within the destination flexible. Like being in one place one day longer or change the itinerary based on weather. So being able to accommodations short-term. This time it would also be cool to have 1 or 2 afternoons on beaches if it is warm. Also budget is not really a big factor on our side.

Some trips we loved in the past: Georgia (country), Scotland, Andalusia, Portugal

&#x200B;

Places we currently have a look at include:

&#x200B;

Colombia - Looks amazing, however it is a huge country so domestic flights are mandatory i guess

Vietnam - We are really interested in the northern part and would have been our first choice. However, it looks like this time of the year is not the best for this area (e.g. for Sapa)

Thailand - Northern Part as well here combined with maybe Laos and a few days in the south for some beach feeling (domestic flight as well). Also more touristic maybe?

Costa Rica - Looks also amazing, however we are not sure if it might be a little bit too touristic for our taste. Also more expensive, than the other destinations.

Guatemala - Somewhat hard to get to from Austria unfortunately, however combining with Belize seems to be quite interesting

&#x200B;

We are open to other suggestions too - for example countries in Africa. However, I have absolutely no idea in any country in Africa (unfortunately). Also maybe I am a bit too put off by countries being too touristic or the domestic flights.

Some places we excluded are: India, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Bali

In googling for self-guided walking tours of one of the cities we'll be visiting, I ran across GPSMyCity. I've downloaded the app and it looks neat. I see there are in-app purchases, but I haven't encountered any yet. 

Have you used this app? What did you think of it? Did you encounter any in-app purchases? If so, what types of things do they charge for?

Thank you!",2022-12-15 21:55:07

Cairo December 2022- What an experience!,26,zmnh6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zmnh6k/cairo_december_2022_what_an_experience/,6,1671117247.0,"I felt compelled to share my experience because when I was planning my trip, there was so much mixed information- although I think this post will only contribute to that. So just a quick backstory- I'm a solo female traveler, mid-30s from Chicago. I'm a pretty well seasoned traveler- I've been a few dozen countries including Morocco (solo and great experience) and Turkey (with another girlfriend and another great experience). I only say this as just a little background on my own experience and that it won't be everyone else's experience. I also say this as a woman with dark features- my blonde girlfriends have had different experiences traveling. I also need to stop saying ""experience"" so much haha.

Cairo is INTENSE! I wasn't bothered my being scammed or harassed, honestly the worst part was the insanity of the traffic. Like, I was hesitant to do the normal amount of exploring I do because there didn't seem to be any discernible traffic laws and everyone just walks out into the street into traffic to cross. It was just a lot. Honestly, the scammers weren't nearly as bad as in maybe even Spain. I will say, I tried to pre-order an Uber to go go the airport to come home and had two drivers cancel on me so I grabbed a taxi. The driver tried to say 1300 Egyptian pounds (which is INSANE, thats like $60) and I was like um no, I'll give you 200. We settled on 250 which was reasonable. You just have to be confident to know when you need to speak up and haggle. I told him, I am a stupid American but I'm not that stupid- and we both laughed. The pollution is wild in Cairo, too. These were the two things that stood out to me the most and I feel like weren't as frequently mentioned in the other overviews I had read both on here and just online in general. Aside from constantly being worried I was going to be hit my a car (whether in a car or on foot) I genuinely felt very safe. I took the subway from the city center to Coptic Cairo- and was surprised to see a woman's only car! It's not mandatory but honestly I loved it and I wish Chicago would do this, maybe that's a hot take? But the subway was clean and efficient. 

Anyway- I hired a guide from Viator for my day at the pyramids, the bazaar, the museum, and he was great. I felt safe and learned a lot. Riding a camel is very fucking scary lol (but my camel was very sweet, I'm just a little bitch). Like I said above, I ventured to Coptic Cairo to walk around. I got there early in the morning and just sort of explored the religious complex- very cool! Also a great way to get out into the city a bit. I also walked around Zamalek. I did a food tour my last night (look up Food Tours with Mila) and she took us to Al Omal City which is a very local neighborhood on the west side of the Nile- I'm actually not sure if it was Giza or Cairo but only about 15 mins from my hotel which was right by Tahrir Square. Was in a group of about 4 of us (another solo traveler and a couple) and had a great time. The food was delicious (apparently pigeon tastes like turkey) and Mila was really delightful (and we love supporting a woman owned business!). 

Overall, I had a great time and am glad I went. With that said, probably the average American tourist would be really overwhelmed (again, not tooting my own horn, I've just been to several non-western countries before- and Cairo made Istanbul feel like child's play lol). But I also felt safe and this was just such an amazing trip I will always remember. Living in Chicago I am CONSTANTLY complaining about Chicago drivers (and still will haha) but have a new appreciation for our traffic laws and street lights and crosswalks. Oh yeah, I flew Royal Jordanian. Chicago to Amman to Cairo and reverse on the way back (obviously). It was fine- food was fine, flights were smooth, no delays, no issues with check-ins or transfers at all. Amman has a VERY nice airport! Honestly, the Cairo airport was nice too. I flew out of Terminal 2 and it was modern and clean. LaGuardia before the renovation was a million times worse. Anyway, that's just my two cents. Glad I went and am also glad to be home.",2022-12-15 17:14:07

Positive Egypt experience,22,zmfq7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zmfq7n/positive_egypt_experience/,7,1671091339.0,"I have just returned from a trip to Egypt and I had a wonderful time. I haven't posted much on this reddit, but felt the need to share the positive experience I had in Egypt. The reason is that I almost did not go because of the many negative experiences that I found here, especially about the vendors and I felt it was needed to provide a different view.

TL;DR: Vendor and taxi touts are there when visiting the tourist sites (especially around the entrance) but when you ignore them/their shops (we never buy something at such stands) and you stay in some quieter areas (e.g. Zamalek, West Bank, Elephantine Island) our experience was that Egypt is definitely better than for example Cuba, India, Peru, Bangkok or Morocco (last two were the worst we experienced).

Just as background, my wife and I are 35 years old from Western Europe and have travelled to some 15 countries in mainly Asia and Latin America in the last 10 years.

We spent time in cairo, giza, luxor, aswan and safaga. In all honesty, the time I was most annoyed was in the all-inclusive hotel in safaga when on the beach every 10 minutes someone from the hotel's salesteam/animation team came around to ask to participate in an activity, massage, spa treatment, excursion, etc.

In Cairo we stayed in the Zamalek area (the island) which I understood to be an international/ambassy district. Whenever we walk on the streets there, we were never approached for anything it was a very nice neighbourhood; also because it was quite green compared to the other parts of cairo. We had an egyption sim and mainly used Uber to travel around; worked like a charm. When entering the Egyption Museum we were approach by a guy who offered himself as guide but he moved on directly as we declined. Also occasionally when walking on the streets a taxi drove slowly to offer services, but all directly left upon when we said no/ignored them.

In Luxor we stayed at the West Bank and it was a very nice and calm area as well. Whenever we walked on the streets there, we were never approached by anyone. Similar for Aswan (we stayed at Elephantine island). Only when we crossed the water by ferry, at the ferry terminal we were always offered taxis but I guess that makes sense.

Around the larger tourist sites such as Giza, Valley of Kings, Karnak, Abu Simbel, etc there are many shops. We never buy at such shops anyway so we don't go into the shops/look at their stuff. At every site I believe someone asked to come visit their shop, but we thanked them and that was it. Vendors also sometime stood in our walking path to show their salesware but we just sidesteps and walked on. Also the guards in Gizah/King's Valley were all fine, they just sticked to their job of checking your ticket. On advise of our guide (who is not allowed in tombs/pyramids) we did tip on guard so that he showed as some hidden features in a tomb that we otherwise would not have seen (totally worth it!); the brilliance of these people 3000 years ago was astonishing.

When I compare Egypt it is probably most close to Mexico in terms of street vendor/taxi approaches. Itn our experience it was definitely better than for example Cuba, India, Peru, Bangkok and Morocco.

When you offset this  against what the country has to offer in terms of history and the beauty of reliefs, temples, pyramids (and then you realize these are 3000-4000 years old!) and in terms of food (although admittedly the Libanese restaurant we tried in Cairo made us want to visit Libanon next) visiting is a no-brainer.",2022-12-15 10:02:19

- budget is USD $1500 ish. for reference we usually stay in marriot hotels and fly spirit when traveling domestically 

- some things we like: history, art, beaches, live music/plays, nerdy stuff

- some things we're not into: shopping/places solely to spend money, long lines and crowded places, main attraction being alcohol

Day 1-4: Johannesburg

\- Arrive and get settled, then visit Apartheid Museum, Constitution Hill, Pieterson Museum, Cradle of Humankind

Day 4-6: Durban

\- Hoping to drive down to Durban and visit the Kranzkloof Nature Reserve, maybe the marine world; any additional things to do here appreciated.

Day 6-8: Hogsback

\- Big Lord of the Rings fan so planning to drive onwards to Hogsback to visit Away with the Fairies, the waterfall, forest, etc. 

Day 8-10: Plattenburg Bay

\- Robberg Nature Reserve, Snorkeling with the Seals (is this inadvisable in June because of the weather?) 

Day 10-14: Cape Town

\- Robben Island, Table Mountain, Boulders Beach, Chapman's Peak Drive

**Safety**: Aside from the usual precautions, is there anything that we should know about any of the above destinations? We're both mid-20s guys (of Indian descent), if that matters.

**Road Trip**: Any routes/roads to avoid or any things we must see along the way?

Googling things like ""Monterey Ca downtown nightlife"" doesn't seem to really help properly understand the vibe since most cities have downtowns but not all of them are fun (DTLA anyone?)

A couple of examples of what I am looking for :

My wife and I have 9-10 days off in February. We‚Äôre looking to book a last minute trip in the next week or two. 

We‚Äôd like to do something more adventurous than luxurious. Not really worried about budget. We live in the US.

- Trekking to Machu Picchu 
- Backpacking in Patagonia 
- Going to Vietnam and exploring 

Open to basically any other suggestions you all have. Only places off of the list would be Western Europe, Japan, Mexico, Guatemala as we‚Äôve been there recently.

Orbitz Price Guarantee is a scam,4,zm50nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zm50nj/orbitz_price_guarantee_is_a_scam/,25,1671058805.0,"Made the mistake of using Orbitz to book a flight on Monday.  The very next day I checked the same flight - exact same itinerary and flight numbers - and the cost had decreased by $140.

I remember reading something about a price guarantee and found this link: https://www.orbitz.com/p/info-other/guarantees

It says ""Thanks to the Orbitz Price Guarantee, you can book with confidence, knowing that if you find your flight, car rental, cruise or activity cheaper on our site or another site within 24 hours, we'll refund you the difference.""

Within the 24 hours I tried to fill out the form and there is a bug where the field for the new, lower price would not accept the input.  I tried different browsers, computers, incognito, different formats of the number, etc. and there is simply a bug in the form - it is broken.

I then chatted with someone online to get a refund of the difference.  For an hour this chat went on as I tried to politely explain to the person the situation.  They could not help me.

Today, I've called 4 representatives (sounds like they are in Latin America) and each told me a different thing.  One told me that I have to ""buy"" the price guarantee when I pay for the flight.  Another told me if the form didn't work there was nothing they could do.  Another put me on hold for 30 minutes (gave up).  The last person put me on hold and then the call disconnected.

The Orbitz price guarantee is clear.  My itinerary is exactly the same as the cheaper one saw yesterday and still see today. 

I can't believe I've wasted so much time on this.  What is wrong with companies and the world these days?  Is it late stage capitalism?  Companies lie to us, make us speak with overseas representatives who cannot or will not help.  If I were in a banana republic this would make sense.  But I paid $1300 to a USA-based company and they are unable to help me and their guarantee is a load of crap.  At this point, I am just giving up.  $140 would have bought me and my gal a nice dinner but the frustration, stress, and time suck is not worth it.

Mainly I want to do some easy/moderate hikes and landscape photography but as I‚Äòm no professional alpinist safety is my highest priority. I‚Äòve researched some locations already and would like to hear some of your opinions or experiences about them:

Lago di Braies

Have been there during summer, easily accessible, nice hike around the lake and great photo location. Seems to be pretty safe to do the hike in winter too. 

Tre Cime Loop / Cadini di Misurina Viewpoint

Would have loved to go there but seems too dangerous in winter and not very accessible as the toll road is currently closed. Maybe any alternative to get a nice view on the Tre Cime?

Alp di Siusi

Nice plateu with a great view. Pretty safe I guess as there are residential buildings and hotels around and I would love to stay a night there to catch the sunrise over the valley in the morning. 

Cinque Torri Hike

How about this one? I was thinking about going up with the cable car, do a loop and hike down the 425 trail back to the cable car station. Unfortunately I haven‚Äòt found any info if this is also possible in the winter season.

Gola di Fanes

Beautiful waterfalls along a very accessible trail. This is gonne be no problem I guess. 

San Giovanni

Also a residential/hotel area I consider safe to stay and freely walk around and this town has a very photogenic church I want to visit.

Do you have any other suggestions or feedback to my list? Beside the hiking and photogrpahy maybe a day in a thermal bath would be nice to relax inbetween if there are any. Really appreciate your answers :)",2022-12-15 00:16:01

My SO and I will be driving from Portland to Phoenix in 8 days. I haven't booked overnight accommodation yet because I wanted to be flexible in case of weather. My biggest concern is running into poor weather conditions. 

One possible route is I-5 down to LA and then I-10. The biggest concern here in the mountain pass over the California / Oregon border. We would likely stay in Ashland, OR on 12/22 and then drive down to LA on 12/23 which means we would be going over Siskiyou Summit in the early morning. I'm looking at forecasts for Ashland and it seems like it'll be well above freezing around that time. I can't seem to find anything for Siskiyou Summit this far out in advance.

The other option is  through southeastern Oregon / central Nevada into Las Vegas. As far as I know, there aren't any mountain passes on this route though it is mostly high elevation and very remote two lane roads which I don't like. We would probably stay in Burns, OR on 12/22 and then drive to Vegas on 12/23.

Which option do you think is better?

Japan travel with criminal conviction in Australia

Hi all, first time posting on here.(bit of background) I live in Australia and have a New Zealand Passport.
My partner and I are getting married next year in April and have booked travel to Tokyo next year in August.
I was convicted of a minor dr** possession charge in Australia in 2015 which is on my criminal record. I have seen things about just ticking ‚ÄòNO‚Äô on the incoming entry card when going over on the 90 day visa free travel and just not declaring anything to do with my record.

The things I was wondering, I will be changing my name through marriage after my wedding, I have a conviction in Australia but have a New Zealand Passport. 

Will any of this help possibly deter me being turned back at the border?

Any advice from fellow Australians or Kiwis will be much appreciated or just anyone who has been in this situation!

- hot air balloons aren't always available and can cancel at any given time without refund

Mine in particular is during air travel, I feel like the boarding and disembarking process for planes SUCKS across all airlines. Doesn‚Äôt it make sense to load from the back to the front AND adding an exit on the back of the plane to double the speed of exiting passengers? Seems like common sense and airlines wound increase their turnover of planes as well as lower complaints. 

Note: I typically fly southwest, so this is a little more irritating on my part. But I fly United and Delta often for work, and it seems like if everyone already has their seat assignments, they could still benefit from back to front boarding, I‚Äôm sure first class/business class will like that they get extra time to get to the gate/board instead of their complementary sparking water and stale cookies or whatever.

I‚Äôve had a deeper look and found that I can do a Bilateral Visa Waiver which would give me an extra 90 days but I would have to stay in that country for the total 90 days and if I‚Äôm correct it would not effect my 90/180 Schengen Days.

Initially I‚Äôm going to be flying over by myself so this is how I‚Äôve mapped out my travel 

April, May, June - Bilateral Visa Waiver in one of the 3 countries (Portugal, Spain or Italy)

July, August, September - Use all 90/180 of my Schengen Days traveling other countries with friends that are coming over.

While I‚Äôm on my Bilateral Visa Waiver I don‚Äôt want to be in the same town/city for the whole 3 months and still want to move around, roughly about 10 days per city/town give or take a day or 2.

In January I'm gonna start my trip through Africa (starting in Morocco, following the west-coast to South-Africa) for 14 months in my Landrover Defender.

While it will obviously not be possible to be completely safe in terms of choosing the least dangerous roads, certain countries are especially dangerous when it comes to kidnapping foreigners. So I was wondering, if you have any tips or resources how to plan your trip in dangerous countries? Just using GoogleMaps would be a Roulette game, since usual Map Providers do not really care about the crime rate at certain roads. I've heard several stories from tourists traveling through Namibia and were lucky enough to be warned about certain roads by locals. From your experience: Is talking to locals generally the best approach, or do you know any other resources to be used?

I (M24) am planning my first solo travel trip to Europe. I will be going from last week of December to the second week of February. I realize that this is not the most fortunate time, but it was about the only time that I could make this necessary trip happen. 

While there, I aim to keep my budget <$8k. I am looking to go to museums, eat, drink, and party to live music with people I meet in hostels. 

My current itinerary includes: 

Lisbon>Madrid>Barcelona from December 25 to approx. Jan. 12. I will be in company of friends for the first two destinations and accommodations have already been made. I will have a Eurail Global Pass that is valid from Jan. 5 to Jan. 19. 

I will fly out of Amsterdam February 7, and would love to spend a few days there. I realize that my arrival and departure locations are not the easiest to fill between. 

I have an idea in mind of a route that I want to take, but I am worried that I have the completely wrong idea. I am also slightly worried that the weather will try to get me down.

I am planning on embracing the winter and finding snow. Snow is good. However, I am not opposed to completely changing my projected route for the best overall experience. 

Currently, I would love to/am debating going to Venice (2d) >Ljubljana (3d) >Budapest>Vienna>Prague>Berlin>Amsterdam. 

Venice and Ljubljana have always been a dream of mine, but dreams can wait.

Its my first longer trip and also my first time in the US. I havent decided which coast I wanna go.

I worked as a temp at my workplace over the summer, and then earlier this month I was offered the opportunity to extend my contract until June (travelling from the beginning of May).

I don‚Äôt particularly like the role but I really like my colleagues and they do so much work for crappy pay.

However - in 2023, I'll be away for much longer periods, like several months at a time, which will require some heavier warmer clothes. I'm also going to want space to take away some ayurvedic herbs, souvenirs, etc. from India.

It has always been a challenge to fit everything in my 21"" TUMI, especially because I'm a meditation teacher and travel with a brass puja kit and teaching supplies that cannot be sourced locally. 

I am growing weary of the ""packing game"" and considering just buying a checked luggage which I would equip with an AirTag for tracking and a protective cover. 

I'm considering the Briggs & Riley Baseline Spinner Large, because the XL size is 68.5"" total dimensions, and my preferred airline American's oversize limit is 62"". 

I'm a OneWorld ruby member, so free checked bags, but that won't help with oversize limits.

&#x200B;

QUESTION 1:  In your experience, how strict are airlines (specifically American) about the oversize dimensions? Do you think I should go for the 68"" dimensions and hope nobody notices? I definitely don't want to spend $1000 on a bag if I'm going to have to spend $100 to check it every time. 

QUESTION 2: Does anyone have any better recommendations than the B&R Baseline series if I am willing to spend around $900?

Italy Trip // Planning Help,1,zl1yye,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zl1yye/italy_trip_planning_help/,12,1670953879.0,"Hi All!

My husband and I are looking to do a trip to Italy this May/June. We have blocked 2 weeks. We are 30 and this will be our first large trip away from our toddler. Looking to relax, drink wine, and eat pasta.

When I went to plan I got a little overwhelmed with how many options of amazing places there we to choose from. Looking for some help in narrowing down where we should go. 

Here are some high level criteria:

-	We are not interested in visiting large cities and would prefer smaller villages, wine regions, countryside, quieter areas. Specifically want to avoid Rome - I have been before and was not a fan
-	We definitely want to visit some cool wineries and spend time in wine regions 
-	we plan to rent a car and are ok with bopping around a fair amount
-	my husband wants to visit the Ferrari factory 
-	we have Lake Como and Dolomites on our lists but realize these are fairly far - wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to try to incorporate into our trip?
-	we prefer staying at small boutique hotels or bed and breakfasts - ideally the more private the better
-	an ideal day would be waking up slow, hanging out by the pool where we are staying, wandering into town for some lunch, exploring a bit, hanging at our spot, then wine and dinner 


Appreciate any advice. There are so many wine regions! Which have the most going on? So we can spend time hopping around? I worth hitting the coast? Or is all inland the move?

Appreciate any and all advice!!

She reveals to me on day 2 she's going to meet a guy, without even telling me while we were planning this. So now on day 2 for half the day I'm alone. On night 2 she wants me to go to this club, which I agreed to without really wanting to for her sake, but then when I ask her to book tickets for another event we both agreed on, she said she's changed her mind and basically says no (despite me saying I really wanted to do it.)

She then shows me the conversation with this guy she's meeting and he kept asking to see a photo fo me, because he wants to hear my accent (I'm from abroad staying in the country with my friend.) I made it clear I wasn't going to meet him, and didn't want him to have my photo.

The girl asks if I'll be okay on my own while she's on her date and I agree, though the whole idea was to travel and explore the city together so obviously I'm not okay, I'm just lying. My issue is, when I'm exploring alone, I really don't want to bump into them two on their date, or return to my hotel room with her to find them doing something (as she suggested may happen) with all my belongings there...

I am uncomfortable with the situation but I do want to go explore the city and travelling with this ""friend"" is safer and easier for me than going alone. So I'm definitely going to go. I just need advice on how to set my boundaries please. Thanks everyone

- Tuesday night to Friday (2-5): Stay in Porto
- Friday to Tuesday (5-9): take early morning train back to Lisbon, stay there. Potentially do trip to Sintra on Monday.
- Tuesday (9): Depart Lisbon (early morning flight)

What are people‚Äôs thoughts on Coimbra? Is just a day trip enough to Coimbra or is it worth staying 1 night there? Is there a different city that‚Äôd be better to visit in its place? Or would it be better to not stop at all & go straight to Porto, and instead add an extra day in Lisbon to do a Sintra day trip? 

Would love any opinions. I don‚Äôt want to feel rushed or pack too much in since I only have a week, but I also want to make sure I‚Äôm not missing anything really worthwhile. I‚Äôm pretty open to anything but mostly going places with good nightlife would be ideal.

Would my plan to visit the schengen area work?,0,zkzdvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zkzdvv/would_my_plan_to_visit_the_schengen_area_work/,15,1670947894.0,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a third world country citizen and I have always wanted to travel to Europe. I have never travelled overseas before. 

I own a digital business that provides me with a good amount of income. I have recently discovered about the Estonian startup visa and I feel like this is something I could get. 

So I was thinking if I could get this visa for 1 year and then travel 8-9 schengen countries in Europe? Could I do that? 

Another problem is that I'd have to keep working remotely while travelling. So as long as I don't tell anyone, would that be fine? 

Honestly, I don't want to take any huge risks because if I get a travel ban on my already super weak passport, that could be very dangerous for any future travel/moving to abroad plans. 

Please advise. Thank you in advance.",2022-12-13 18:11:34

A number of things.

1. We are both occult heavy people, and plan on doing the cemetery no 1 tour ""as we apparently cant just walk through."" As well as the museum of death. We would appreciate things such as these.

2. I'd love to go to a chill jazz/cigar lounge that's not too crowded. Aka nowhere near Bourbon st. Somewhere comfortable and not rowdy. I'm not much of a ""party"" person but love the idea of easy going adult spots to hang out at. Mainly I don't wanna get puked on cause I'll be dressed up somewhat in some formal/occult ware.

3. We already understand stuff about hecklers, scammers ""bet $10 I know where you got dem shoes.""

4. We are from south Ga and from videos we watched a lot of food is VERY similar to our southern/swamp food. BUT I would love a decent low country boil. Most if the stuff I get here tend to be very lackluster. We have crawfish, oysters, shrimp, ect. The Savannah area in GA is pretty similar in food diversity, but from what I've seen lacks the spice diversity in New Orleans. I'd actually suggest going to Savannah and taking some tours there for people coming to Ga.

5. We will definitely be going to the main streets. Bourbon, Frenchmen, Royal, ect. Looking for some off-main areas to go. 

6. I'm pretty good with my French ""I know creole is different but I should be able to get a few things"" so if ya got some hard to find french/creole speaking places I'd love the challenge.",2022-12-13 17:39:37

I‚Äôm planning a weekend getaway to Madrid. Plans made and flights purchased, all that‚Äôs left to do is book a hotel. It‚Äôs been 3 days of research, I still haven‚Äôt got a place to stay, and to top it all off I‚Äôm becoming angrier by the minute. So here‚Äôs my journey so far:

I go on booking.com and start my search. There are 1657 available properties. Since I‚Äôm well past my hostel bunking days, I‚Äôm looking for a nice double bed with a private bathroom. Great, so far my search has been narrowed down to 1226 properties. I already stay in an apartment, so I want an actual hotel so I could feel more like I‚Äôm on holiday than just at a different home. Incredibly, this filters it down to just 280 properties.

Should I filter out by star rating or not? I mean I‚Äôve stayed at beautiful 3-star hotels and run-down 4-star hotels. Can I afford a 5-star? I‚Äôll go for all just in case there‚Äôs a 3-star gem or a good discount on a 5-star. 256. There‚Äôs still 256 hotels left to choose from.

Even if narrow it down to a central location - there‚Äôs still over 100 properties to look at. Of course I only checked out the first few pages, but I think I managed to pick out 9 contenders. It‚Äôs only been 3 or so hours of my life, but who‚Äôs counting at this point.

Now I‚Äôm going to go and read reviews, critically evaluate them (eliminate potential entitled Karen reviews as well as the ones from i‚Äôm just happy to be here guy), compare amenities, and of course the prices. The hotel I‚Äôm currently looking at costs 490‚Ç¨ (3 nights, full stay) on booking.com, 430‚Ç¨ on Orbitz, but we have a winner with Agoda, selling the room for 401‚Ç¨. And I‚Äôm yet to check a bunch of other websites for their prices.

So far I‚Äôve thoroughly checked one of the hotels from my list, and after almost 2 hours I‚Äôve abandoned my research to come vent here. I mean it‚Äôs great having all these options catering to different kinds of travellers, but is it getting to be too much? If I keep up this research I‚Äôll end up spending more time planning my holiday than actually being on it.

How do you people do it? Do you have a system? Any quick painless ways to choose and book a hotel? Help a frustrated traveller out, please.",2022-12-13 16:56:54

We were on our Honeymoon in Florida and hired and RV from indie campers to travel the Florida Keys (Highly recommend Florida keys). When we hired it with them all the marketing on their website suggested to take out the premium protection insurance and reduce your ""maximum"" liability to $200. This is entirely false marketing to lure you in and written in the fine print of the contract there is a huge list of exceptions to the ""maximum"" liability, the roof, below the wheels, engine, the inside, damage whilst not driving, damage by wildlife, break-in... You name it, it's probably excluded. Therefore you have an uncapped liability for their campervan on your trip! 

We got charged $5.4k for a dent to the roof 2 weeks after our rental, no communication from indie campers on it, they just took it straight from my credit card. I would like to say we're a one off but they do this daily to people.

2. I know people mention Colmar as part of the wider Alsace region‚Äîbut I'm a bit overwhelmed with where to start. What other towns should I visit? Can I do a day tour around the area? Is 2.5 days enough time to manage this? I want to note, I do want my experience in Colmar to be relaxing; I want to do and see things but I do not want to be on a super tight schedule.

I am planning a trip to South Korea and Japan this coming March. The most affordable way I found so far is to book a round-trip ticket to South Korea and another round-trip ticket to Japan leaving from Seoul (two itineraries). Would I hit any major or minor hurdles if I do it this way?

Plan:

* Flying out from the US to Korea then immediately (same day) fly out to Japan with a 2.5 hour window between flights. Est. time arrival is 4:30am and my Japan flight is at 7am.
* Fly back to Korea after a week and stay for the remainder of my trip before flying back to the States.

A few questions too:

* Will immigration take more than 2.5hours if my arrival time is 4:30am? Is this enough time for me to catch my Japan flight?
* Should I book a later Japan flight to include enough time for potential delays?
* Am I correct when I say, I believe once I arrive in Korea, I will have to go through immigration, pick up my luggage, and check in & security for my Japan flight.
* Will I need 2 K-ETA for Korea? One for the first flight entering the country and another when I‚Äôm coming back from Japan.

But my question is can I travel on that ferry as a tourist with an Indian Passport? I mean is that are immigrations available at ferry port in calais and dover? Or this is just available for the locals who can travel restriction free without any immigrations. 

I have checked that buses from france which requires Visa for UK also use these ferries to cross the sea. Please help!",2022-12-13 10:56:35

During procedure there are no specific answer about travel to Cuba. Booked my ticket for a last year trip to NY. I was pretty sure ban apply only for travel to Cuba after Jan 2021.

Q&A on website are not clear i assumed Cuba has been designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 2021 so in 2016 i didn't visit a State Sponsor of Terrorism.  

Accidentally yesterday i read a post wich claim this ban apply for ALL travel to Cuba and I panicked.

I visited Cuba in 2016. Got a stamp on my passport.

I looked for official infos on web but the only ""official"" statements are from US Embassy in France wich specify:*"" Additionally, if you have traveled or resided in* ***Cuba*** *on or after January 12, 2021, please be advised that you will need a visa in order to travel to the U.S.""*

And on IATA timatic system wich report same info:

""*Warning: Passengers must obtain an ESTA authorization at* [*https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/*](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)*.*

*Passengers who have been in Cuba on or after 12 January 2021 are not allowed to enter with an ESTA authorization*.""

Wrote 3 mails to CBP but got no answer.

Does somebody have more info or some official link on this topic?

Day allocation: SF - L.A. - Las Vegas,1,zkpuf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zkpuf4/day_allocation_sf_la_las_vegas/,21,1670916988.0,"Dear travel folks,

I just got a question regarding how I will spent my SFC-LA-Las Vegas-SFC days.

*Important info: I won't rent a car so I am focused on walking, PublicTrans and in worst cases Ubering as I am on a budget.*

This saturday I'll go to San Francisco and stay there until the 20th of december (like 3 days).

In the evening of the same day I'll take the bus to L.A. overnight. I'd like to spent at least 2 days in L.A. - 1 day doing a city tour where I peek at much as possible for example using a hop-on bus (no car!) or a guided tour and 1 day at the universal studios.

My following plans  were to go to Las Vegas for 2 days (23rd - 24th) and then fly back to SFC on 25th where I will leave three days later in the morning.

As I think it could be too many days just in SFC, I thought about different options:

\- One would be to use the last days beginning on 25th to make two daytrips to Oakland and Sacramento for a day each and spent the last day again in SFC.

\- Otherwise as I am already driving down to L.A. I could extend my stay for like 1-2 days (Las Vegas is a maximum of 2 days as I am just curious how it looks there and I won't really gamble).  Maybe there would be a closer daytrip possbility in L.A.?

I am that kind of tourist that likes to browse around and explore neighboorhoods by foot, maybe does a few nature trips but city is always fine, mostly keeps it on budget, but will also spend some dollars on touristy stuff. I don't drink alcohol, I am travelling solo, like to find cheap eats (if that helps you in any way to categorize me).

What do you think - how and why would you change the days on this?


EDIT:

Thank you all! 

I will spent 3 days ins SF - 3 in LA - 2 Vegas  and the last two again in SF. 
I won‚Äòt worry about my stay in SFC and just go for it. Will make more detailed destination plans for LA to minimize transport and spend one day in Vegas looking around and one day at Grand Canyon. Last two days in SF will probably be a daytrip.",2022-12-13 09:36:28

I have a fairly negative view of insurance companies, so my immediate thought is that this is just a gotcha.  That if you make a claim they will look for some prepaid, non-refundable trip arrangement that was not insured so they can avoid paying out the reimbursement.  

But, I'm not so arrogant that I think I know more about insurance than I do.  So, what's the validation for this clause? What, if anything, am I missing?

In a bit of a strange situation with an upcoming trip, and just curious if anyone has been in this position before, and if so what you did.

I have a trip in January 2023 booked and paid for, with the following flight originally booked through Philippine Airlines.

21/01 Sydney to Manila  
3hr Layover in Manila  
21/01 Manila to Tokyo (Arriving around midnight)

As such, I have also booked and paid for accommodation on the 21/01 in Tokyo, staying in a hotel at the airport I'm flying into. It's non-refundable.

Yesterday, I received notification that my connecting flight to Tokyo has been cancelled, and I have been booked on a flight the next morning, so that my itinerary is now:

21/01 Sydney to Manila  
16 hr Layover in Manila  
22/01 Manila to Tokyo (Arriving around 2pm)

I'm obviously slightly annoyed to be arriving later, but I understand these things happen. MY issue now is the accommodation for the 21st, having already booked in Tokyo I asked what my options were to the airline. The response was that any changes to schedule shorter than 24 hours are not eligible for compensation or accommodation.

As it stands it seems my options are:

1) Book a hotel in Manila and just front up the cost  
2) Sleep in Manila airport (really don't want to do this)  
3) Keep pushing the airline

As mentioned, I'm curious if this (or similar) has happened to anyone else, and if it has, what success you had with the airline and what you ended up doing.

How strict are European airlines with the weight? My flight there has my on France Bee and my flight back I‚Äôm on Air France.

So to start, I was originally planning on flying into Florence but I heard poor things about the airport in Florence (small, many planes rerouted, etc.). So Milan may be a better option from what I have seen/read (cheaper than Rome and better airport than Florence).

As for the trip itself, the plan as of now is to go from Milan to Florence (2 days in Milan and 3 or so in Florence). Florence to Monaco/Nice (I‚Äôm a big formula 1 fan), and 2 or so days in Monaco. Then Monaco to Paris (gf hasn‚Äôt been to Paris and really wants to visit) and the remainder in Paris.

When it comes to travel while in Europe, the plan is to use trains as much as possible and Uber/Lyft if needed in each city. I have been told this is much cheaper and easier than driving or hiring a driver.

As for the rest of the details, much is up in the air and subject to change. Any and all suggestions are welcome considering this will be our first trip abroad without family/friends. Thanks!",2022-12-13 03:27:55

I will be travelling for the first time as an adult and I am intending to go carry-on only. The airline allows a carry-on bag as well as a 'personal item' that can be no larger than 40x30x10cm.  


The 40x30 cm isnt really a problem. Going by those limits i can find plenty of backpacks that would be suitable. The 10cm depth however seems like it could be a problem.

I really dont want to get caught out and have to check my main carry on luggage, i would rather just pay a fee to keep both with me at all times, but from what i understand that might not be an option. I just dont want to deal with potentially lost baggage to start my holiday.

Does anyone know, if i were to buy a bag with a max 20cm depth, but only fill it so that it fits the required measurements when squished, would that be accepted by the average airline and even budget ones? Or is it expected to be 40x30x10 in an 'un-squished' state?  


I am flying soon so would really appreciate any advice so i know what kind of bag i should be purchasing!",2022-12-12 22:39:37

Does anyone know if the airline has an idea in advance of what flights it is going to cancel? If they're just stringing us along by booking us onto flights they know won't ship where does that fit in to the whole deal with passengers rights. 

We've been booked another flight tomorrow through their app but frankly I'm 95% sure it'll be canceled by noon tomorrow. Nobody will actually talk to us and we have no idea of how we should normally be treated. If we took the eurostar could we get BA to cover the costs?

Pretty much just use it to hold my toiletry bag, JBL speaker, a book, and random little things ect.

I went on my first international trip with a friend this summer (France, Belgium, and a day in Geneva) and it was probably the best 2 weeks of my life. Needless to say, I am looking forward to the next one. 

We are debating between Italy and Sicily, or Greece and Turkey. I am leaning towards Italy and Sicily, but have a high interest in Greece and Turkey as well.

I really want to visit smaller cities and locations to really ""get a feel"" for the country and what it's like living there - we went to a really small town in Belgium called Tongeren and it was amazing. 

I assume that the bigger cities that are more of tourist hotspots are generally safe (with the exception of normal big city things like petty theft and whatnot, basically Toronto vibes), but is Turkey a ""generally"" safe country for tourists who do not speak the language or know the cultural/societal norms?

I'm also thinking about crossing the boarder to Pakistan and spending a few days in Lahore and I have a few questions about that. Also, my departing and arriving flight are from New Delhi so I always need to return to the starting point.
For context, I have to work a bit while travelling so usually travel a bit slower and mostly low cost.


Right now the itinerary I have in mind is the following:

__



25 to 28 - New Delhi - Rest a bit from previous trips and do some light exploration

28 to 4 - Rishikesh - Maybe do some water/adventure activities, also maybe on one or two days visit Haridwar

4 to 12 - Amritsar/Lahore? - This period will be shorter if I can't figure out the border logistics

12 to 21 - Delhi/Agra/Jaipuri - Exploring New Delhi more in depth and do the Golden triangle

__


Feel free to comment on it and give some suggestions.

Now onto to the questions.

1) Around Agra I read about some places of interest like Fatehpur Sikri, Gwalior and Vrindavan. Are these places worthy it to make a short stop or should I just do Agra?

2) I read that it's not possible to use the Wagah Border as your first point of entry in India, since I my first point of entry will be New Delhi does that mean I can then use it without a problem? Assuming I get a multiple entry visa since my plan would be to go from Amritsar, spend 3/4 days in Lahore and go back to Amritsar.

3) Some people told me about places like Shimla and Kasol but I didn't really found a cheap way to get there and since I'm not exactly backpacking I would also like to avoid 15h travelling journeys. If there's any option that I'm missing let me know.

4) If don't end up going to Lahore I'll probably try to go to Varanasi, any other suggestion?

"Trip report - North India, including a couple of days solo travel (F); recommendations",23,zjxx6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zjxx6r/trip_report_north_india_including_a_couple_of/,11,1670848762.0,"Just back from two weeks in India, primary purpose of which was a wedding in Amritsar.

I have so many things to say about this fascinating country, which at times completely overwhelmed me, and at others blew my mind with its moments of beauty at every turn. Places visited were Delhi, Amritsar, Taj Mahal and Rishikesh (Tapovan, specifically).

I was nervous about this trip because whilst most of it was spent with friends, I knew there would be some moments I'd have to spend navigating alone as a solo female (airport and train transfers mostly). Almost everyone I knew who had been to India advised me to not do anything solo in India as a woman, but this is hard to avoid when your plans don't quite correspond exactly with other people's.

Most of my observations are below:

1. Scams. Scams are everywhere and makes it hard to ever let your guard down. Immediately upon arrival, after an Indian woman from my flight sorted a taxi for me, I got into a nasty situation where the driver demanded double, in quite an aggressive way. This started the trip on a bit of a sour point and made me very distrustful. Being on your guard all the time can be exhausting after a while, and make you less likely to want to go out and be spontaneous, as I like to do when travelling. Do your research well, as even [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) reviews turn out to be fake, book things in advance or through a trusted hotel staff member, or Indian friend if possible. Travelling with Indian friends makes things much easier. If travelling solo, or only with other white people, then take your time. Don't feel rushed into making a decision about anything, especially at the airport, when everything can feel overwhelming. Also an Indian SIM card is essential in my mind, I would have felt extremely vulnerable without. Buy from the airport, but be aware it might not activate for 24 hours.
2. Appreciate the small moments. Take some time to sit quietly in a little street vendors shop with some masala chai (like 20 rupees from the road-side). Find the quiet gardens, or daily religious rituals, hidden temples, or chat to locals (the ones who aren't out to scam you or have some hidden agenda, many are just interested in your life). There is nowhere on earth that I've been that is quite like India. Everywhere you turn there are small moments of vibrancy, a friendly cow, a beautiful building. Favourite moments include; exploring my friend's temple, which was an indescribable beauty, watching a river-side Aarti (daily sunset blessing of thanks to the River Ganga), sitting in a streetside vendor shop with a toothless man delightedly gesturing about ""cricket"" and England beating Pakistan, little rides in tuk-tuks. There is peace amongst the total chaos, where you won't be hassled.  The thing I most loved was how open and welcoming so many Indians are, especially in Rishikesh where I would just be randomly invited to join in with a badminton game, a board game, or to join a group of Indian backpackers to a waterfall.
3. Everything will go wrong, or take longer than expected, so allow double the time to do anything. Getting to the station or airport, getting through the airport, having hours and hours added onto a tour as the guides show you ""just one more bazaar"", ""just come and meet my friend, the pashmina seller"". Be assertive with people, say no you have to go, don't schedule things too tightly.
4. Get out of the smoggy cities. I think it was important for me to see both sides of India, both the smog, chaos and claustrophobia of Delhi, compared with the mountainous, riverside freshness of Rishikesh. That being said, there are many fascinating sites in Delhi if you have the energy to tackle it - Jama Masjid and Red Fort are recommended but be aware of your belongings and scammers as they are crazy busy areas. The metro is cheap and efficient, but will be jam packed around the busier sites, less so further out of the city. Indian cities are not really walkable, even if it says 15-20 mins by foot. You will have to navigate cows, zero road rules, avoiding human faeces/piss, and motorbikes on the pavement. In future I'd probably just make use of the domestic flights to bypass Delhi. From my brief travels in the North, my most recommended states for a return visit are Uttarakhand and Rajasthan. Also interested in Himachal Pradesh and the Ladakh regions.
5. You will pay more for most things as a tourist, but it'll still be cheap. Entry to museums is often around 6 x more expensive for foreigners, but still... it'll be like ¬£6-15 compared to 60p for locals, which I think is justifiable. One of my biggest sources of anxiety was trying to find working ATMs as Indian streets are really not super pedestrian-friendly - walking around looking for one is a pain in the ass. Opportunities to pay by card were few and far between so make sure you take out enough cash, and keep it in separate places - wear a money belt and don't leave valuables on display in your hotels or restaurants - there are many opportunists. Expect a decent meal between the 200-600 rupee mark (¬£2-6).
6. Harassment was.... bad. And worse if you are a woman. Selfie requests are endless, begging children following you up the street, as well as people covertly filming you (eg. My uber driver... very creepy). But you can block it out. Just ignore people yelling at you and walk around purposefully. To be honest, most selfie requests were harmless and came from both men and women. Beware that saying yes even once will probably trigger everyone nearby to feel bold enough to ask. You can say no.
7. Foodwise... Amazing stuff if you love Indian food. Avoid anything with tap water in it, cold food, meat and dairy. Best bet is piping hot Indian food and bottled (always check the seal's not broken!) or hot drinks. It's hard to avoid these things all the time though. I was ""careful"", yet still my stomach wasn't great a lot of the time. I didn't get caught short, but Immodium is essential, lol. Even roadside masala chai, I'm a liiittle cynical of, though my friends swore that boiled tap water was fine. Some tap water can be ok if it is filtered by reverse osmosis, as in some restaurants or hotels that are more geared for Westerners.

Would I recommend it for solo travellers? For women, you have to take such extreme caution at all times that it detracts from the enjoyment too much to travel entirely solo. If you have opportunity to see the country from the perspective of Indian friends, then absolutely take it. Otherwise, take caution and do your research well, try not to be on your own for long periods of time if you are female (here and there is okay if you are street savvy and experienced in travelling in non-Western cultures). If you have to travel long-distance solo, then don't take the cheap option. First class AC options by train are still a very reasonable price for foreigners. Shatabdi Express Executive Class was around ¬£14 /1400 rupees from Haridwar to Delhi, very safe, and included a 3-course meal for an extra 368 rupees.

I'm glad I did it, and pushed myself out my comfort zone. Despite being an exhausting place, I've come home with a changed perspective of the world around me and of how 1 billion of our planet live their lives.",2022-12-12 14:39:22

First Time Traveling - need advice on how ambitious I should be,1,zjobbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zjobbp/first_time_traveling_need_advice_on_how_ambitious/,6,1670822482.0,"Hey!  
I am a college student who is traveling alone for the first time ever during my upcoming winter break. I am going to Rome by myself.  
I will have 5 full days to explore around, the 6th day will be focused on getting back to the airport to leave. I was thinking of two options:

1. Simply explore Rome for the whole time - it's my first time traveling, I don't want to get too ambitious
2. Spend 3 days in Rome and 2 days in Venice, if I'm all the way over there, I might as well see as much as I can.

I don't know if I'll get ""bored"" of Rome and want to see Venice as well, because like I said, I might as well if I'm there, but I also don't want to overdo it and be stressing out.

I want to go with the flow and decide what to do when I get there, but I am stressed out about how hotels would work if I decide to go to Venice on the fly. I know its smart to book hotels in advance, but I can't really do that if I don't know what my plan is.

I have always been very interested in geography, and I travel more for the geopolitical aspect rather than wanting to sit on the beach and have an actual vacation. That's why I'm leaning towards wanting to go to Venice as well - to say I've been in two super cool historic cities as opposed to one. A part of me thinks I could be satisfied with having less time in each in order to visit each, but I also haven't traveled and don't know how I'll be feeling.

2.  Suggestions on where to go?  I have a week to do it and would like to do as much as possible with the time I have.  I like hiking and prefer harder, less crowded trails.  Which National Parks are worth visiting along the way?  Restaurant or town recommendations?

3.  Is Mt Kosciuszko worth visiting?  Is it too touristy?

4.  What are the freedom camping laws in Australia?  As an extreme, can I simply pull over onto the shoulder of a quiet road and camp there?  

5.  Is there anything else I should know before my trip?  General advice for campervaning between Melbourne and Sydney?",2022-12-12 06:41:23

Review on Breeze Airlines (budget airline that actually isn't mega ass),2,zjkpq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zjkpq0/review_on_breeze_airlines_budget_airline_that/,8,1670814120.0,"I like to travel a lot, and I gotta say, the absolute worst part about traveling now a days is airlines. From price hikes, to mystery fees, to delays/cancellations and zero refunds or impossible to change flights, to customer service that would make comcast blush. 

Here is a new airline called Breeze. Budget airline granted, doesn't fly everywhere. But...they're actually trying. Quick customer service response, delay or cancellation? 100% refund, or easily change your flight no problem. Hell, even the flight attendants are super nice, and on one of the flights I had with them they even let me sit in the front of the plane even though I fly economy. And while they are a budget airline, they actually serve food and drinks and their seats aren't ultra mega ass (\*cough spirit cough\*), and their baggage policy is quite clear with no mystery fees (\*cough again spirit cough\*).  

I'm writing this because when you look online, a lot of the reviews seem negative. I was initially worried if this was even a legit airline. But I had no issues flying with them, and when it comes to budget airlines (e.g. Ryanair, Wow, Spirit, Frontier, etc.) this is definitely one of the better ones. And since they're new, they actually care about customer service (until they get successful enough they can afford to not give a shit).

TBH, I was surprised that NY wasn't already on the wiki.

I already found a few things I'd like to do, but it won't hurt to hear what other people's suggestions :)

I live in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, so I'm pretty well acquainted with the wonders and perils of a big city. The things I like the most in S√£o Paulo are the cultural venues, such as museums and art exhibitions, the gastronomy (I love to experience all the different foods such a plural city has to offer!), parks (if a park has a museum, or perhaps some sort of nature display, like an orchid garden, it scores high on my list!), and the thousands of ways and locations I can have a beer!

Oh, I should add that I'm a musician (I play the acoustic guitar and a bit of the piano), so I would love anything in that area, ""interactive"" or not. Perhaps point me to a cool jazz bar!

I don't care at all about stuff like the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty, but if there's a touristy thing I really, really should do, I wouldn't be against it. I'm also not a fan of sports in general, so seeing the Mets or the Knicks isn't really my thing.

I figured I got to go to the MoMA, the AMNH, the Met and perhaps Central Park. Top of the Rock also sounds like a cool place to go.

I also would like to eat in a burger joint and pastrami from a deli. Also a bagel, which I always see in TV shows, but never eaten, haha. While reading the Excellent Post from the guidelines, it occurred to me that I should add that I'm looking for both nice meals, as well as street food! BTW, is Benihana (or something similar) still a thing? I've always liked the concept, but never thought about going to the one in S√£o Paulo.

As for my budget, I won't be doing anything really expensive, but overall I'll have a fair amount available for enjoying the city.

I'll be there from December 22 to 29, so I must find something to do during Christmas. I'm an atheist and my family is somewhat catholic, so we wouldn't want to go to a mass or something like that. That's not to say I would oppose visiting old churches for the architecture and stuff, though! My brother who lives there tells me most places will be closed on the 25th, so I'd better have a more detailed plan for that day.

I hope I managed to come as clear and specific as possible, even though I changed a lot of things as I was writing. I'll be very thankful for any and every suggestion!

Here's the idea so far:  
**12/26:** Arrive in Malaga, wander around

**12/27-12/30:** Based in El Chorro for rock climbing. Also planning to hike the Caminito del Rey.

We'll have a car during this time, so we're also open to other things to do in this area or day trips along the Costa del Sur.

**12/31:** We will be making our way toward Seville, but we'll still have the car so it seems fun to do a bit of a road trip along the way-- maybe stopping in Ronda, or other stops?

Also trying to decide where to stay overnight for New Year's eve-- Seville or a smaller town somewhere. It sounds fun to get a low-key NYE drink or gather in the square for grapes and champagne, but it sounds like a lot of the celebrating is either 'gatherings at home with family' and/or 'getting really dressed up and standing in line for the clubs from 2am 'til dawn' with not a lot in between.

**1/1-1/3:** Seville. Nothing too specific planned yet here. My brother is living there so we'll probably have him show us around. Open to suggestions!

Question: At this point, we will still have a car. Due to the one-way fee, it would be more expensive to return it in Seville versus keeping it the rest of the trip. Is it going to be a huge hassle to have it in Seville and Granada? Not planning to drive it at all within the cities, really, but would need to park it somewhere.

**1/4-1/5:** Granada: we have tickets for the Alhambra. Otherwise nothing much planned yet. The Arab baths look cool, as do the Sacromonte Caves. Open to suggestions.

**1/6 and 1/7:** Granada/make our way back to Malaga for our flight in the afternoon of 1/7. Maybe some roadtripping in between along to the coast?

Looking for answers to my specific questions, or ideas about what to do, or general feedback on the plan so far. Still open to changing the itinerary if there's a destination we shouldn't miss.",2022-12-12 00:23:21

 Not into crowds, group tours or party atmosphere. Prefer small family owned or boutique type hotels, sometimes an Airbnb here and there, not into hostels.

Budget is flexible, but not looking to spend a fortune,  like to be comfortable, am more laid-back, not extravagant. Prefer being alone, to being in groups and having to socialize. Like, small towns, villages, cities. Love, beaches and water. Not a big fan of hiking, but occasional  short ones are ok.  Think my travel style is more blend in and explore whatever catches my eye. 

I have almost a month total. I‚Äôll be spending 2-3 days in Istanbul, and then heading to the coast.  I also plan on taking part of a week and going to Egypt (2days) and then Jordon to see Petra (2 days)

Unfortunately, there was an incident that occurred in the room across the hall from ours on the first night of our trip.  Through the walls, I heard an enraged man screaming ‚ÄúAre you ready to f****** die tonight?‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to die tonight!‚Äù, a woman screaming in terror for help, a baby screaming and crying, and glass objects being broken in the room.  I tried to call the front desk and hotel security, without success.  I subsequently left the room and ran to the elevator lobby to try the phone there that states it goes directly to the front desk, also without success. I then took the elevator down to the casino, where I assumed security would be abundant.  When I arrived there, despite my pleas for security to return with me upstairs given my concerns about a woman and/or baby being murdered, security was reluctant to act.  Finally, 1 security guard agreed to return with me upstairs, though he walked the whole way.  When we returned upstairs, the security guard seemed to realize the severity of the threat, and immediately started requesting backup by phone.  However, it took over 15 minutes for anyone else to arrive, during which time another guest popped his head out of his room and yelled ‚ÄúWhere the hell is security?‚Äù and I was confronted and threatened by 2 guests of the room, which the security guard did nothing to stop.  Eventually, someone who identified himself as the director of security arrived.  He opened the room, finding a woman requesting EMS for an unspecified injury, and broken glass and a red liquid all over the entryway.  He spoke privately with the guests of the room, and emerged to advise that nothing would be done as it was a ‚Äúprivate matter.‚Äù  I asked him to call the police, and he said the hotel is private property and they do not involve the police in these matters.  I requested that they call the police anyway, and he refused.  Instead, he summoned housekeeping to immediately start cleaning up the scene, including the red liquid.  Finally, I called the police myself and filed a report.  We were offered a room change initially, but after talking to the police they advised they wouldn‚Äôt offer anything.

We have return flights to Milan and will have 4 weeks after the wedding to travel.

The plan is to stay in Italy for the first 10-12 days before heading to other countries, below is what we've come up with so far:

* 1 - Milan
* 2 - 3 - Bologna (going through Parma & Modena)
* 4 - 5 - Florence
* 6 - 7 - Rome
* 8 - 10 - Almafi Coast
* 11 - 14 - London
* 15 - 17 - Paris
* 18 - 20 - Seville
* 21 - 27 - Greece  ( 2 Athens, 2 Mykonos, 3 Santorini)
* 28 - Milan

Couple of questions.

Do you think we are moving around too much, particularly in Italy?

We were actually thinking of hiring a car in Milan and returning it in Rome before flying out to London, would anyone recommend this over trains?


There was a gap between Paris & Greece so we picked Seville but open to options here (particularly if you think this is too out of the way?)


Greece could also just be 5 days if we got rid of Mykonos.


Me and my partner are really just looking for amazing food, be entrenched in culture and a bit of relaxation for the trip. We'll also party here and there.


Open to suggestions and feedback as this is still relatively flexible.


Thanks",2022-12-11 14:16:47

Urgent - Can I go to Paris? Expiration of passport soon,0,zinu69,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zinu69/urgent_can_i_go_to_paris_expiration_of_passport/,7,1670755941.0,"So, my family has tickets to Paris from London on Dec 12th in the afternoon.

I live in the UK but my family (including younger sibling that is 13 years old) will be landing in London from Chicago the morning of Dec 12th (we are all US citizens).  We just found out that my younger sibling's US passport expires at the end of January and our flight back from the EU to London is on December 24th and their flight back to the US from London is on December 30th. 

My understanding is that the UK should not be an issue for them to enter because the UK just needs the US passport to be valid for the duration of the stay. However, for the EU (Schengen region), they want passports to be valid for at least 3 months after the date you leave the EU).

So, does the fact that my younger sibling is a minor and traveling with family members that all have passports not expiring any time soon, change anything? We have proof of funds, proof of departure flight tickets, confirmed reservations for accommodation, so I don't think that the EU border officials would have any concern that my 13 year old sibling would overstay their visa except for the fact that their passport expires soon. 

Is the 3 month rule a hard rule, or is it more about the combination/big picture of all the indicators that suggest that someone might overstay their visa that matters? If we try to go to Paris from London and my younger sibling is refused entry, does that have any long term implications?

Also, we put in all our passport information on the Chicago -> London and London - > Paris flights on the airline's website and were able to check in and get our boarding passes, which suggests that the airlines don't foresee any problems?",2022-12-11 12:52:21

Make sure you have a passport.

Make sure you have the correct visa.

Understand that Australia is about the same size as the contiguous United States.

Most Australians speak English.

Australian laws apply in all matters in Australia, US laws are irrelevant.

You may not bring any non prescription drugs into the country. You may not carry any type of weapon. You must drive on the left hand side of the road. You need to use Australian currency.

Australians do not care about your religion, politics, how much you earn or how valuable your possessions are. Do not make conversation about any of these things unless, perhaps, asking for directions to a church or particular shop.

Talking loudly to drown out other conversations is considered rude.

Tipping is unnecessary (people are paid reasonable wages) but feel free to leave loose change in the 'tip jar‚Äô if you don't want to carry it.

Say please and thank you to people providing you with a service.

Make sure to spend some time away from major cities.

I custom built a trip that looks like this: 3 days in Dublin (we could rent a car?), fly to Edinburg for 2 days, train to London for 3 days, train to Paris for 3 days, then train to Frankfurt for 2 days.

For Christmas, I‚Äôm booking a family vacation for myself (29f) and my parents (65f and 58m). I asked them where they would like to go most, my mom responded with either England, Ireland or Germany while my dad wants to essentially visit Frankfurt, Germany as he hasn‚Äôt been back since he was stationed there in the 80‚Äôs. 

I‚Äôm planning a 2 week trip, and the hard part is deciding what places we can do in that amount of time. I looked at GET tours, and they had a ‚ÄúEuropean Whirlwind‚Äù that seemed attractive (from London, Amsterdam, Paris, Lucerne, Heidelberg, Venice) but it doesn‚Äôt account for any ‚Äúfree days‚Äù or unstructured travel. 

I‚Äôve lived in London previously, and am not too worried about hitting the top things there with such little time, as they are older and things like a BigBus tour would be fine.

I am currently planning a trip to go snorkeling with Whale Sharks down in Mexico and would like to spend other days exploring the local areas. I recently though have hit a roadblock in trying to decide on La Paz region or Cancun region for my trip. I would be making this trip either at the very end of the season in La Paz around early April or the very beginning of Cancun's season in late May so Im not sure what to expect in terms of water quality, likelihood of encounters, and quality of trip. Im not much of a touristy type and dont typically enjoy crowds which is one of the reasons I'm hesitant of Cancun; especially if the whale shark trips are going to be absolutely packed with people. I think I would prefer the more natural and authentic feels of the towns of Baja Sur; I just worry about missing out on the Whale Shark season or the waters becoming to murky to enjoy.  What are your opinions on these two towns/regions? Have you swam with whale sharks during these times?

I used to LOVE AirB‚ÄônB. In fact, I haven‚Äôt stayed in hotels since 2016, always choosing AirB‚Äôn‚ÄôBs instead. I always found them simply better quality ‚Äî more space and utilities for less money. However, now‚Ä¶sadly I think some precious part of the AirB‚ÄônB magic is gone. It‚Äôs like it sold its soul. 

The last place I stayed in (November, 2022) had a pretty high cleaning fee AND I was left with a list of chores to do before I left. Actually, I‚Äôm neat and tidy so I clean up anyway but what got me most was the little laminated signs hung up everywhere. They all said ‚ÄúIf you use it, YOU CLEAN IT‚Äù. The last part was in all caps, bolded and underlined. It was like being stuck in a passive aggressive employee break room. Yucky.

And the worst thing is, I felt compelled to keep this feedback private for fear of retaliation from the host. 

AirB‚ÄônB have either failed to see this trend coming, or they think its negligible from a business point of view. I guess the gradual swing away from AirB‚ÄônB isn‚Äôt hurting their balance sheet enough‚Ä¶yet. 

It reminds me a little of the way eBay went. Once upon a time eBay had charm and was all about peer-to-peer commerce. Then all the mass-produced items flooded the site and it‚Äôs just a poor substitute for Amazon.

Edit to add: a helpful commenter shared this: https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-is-introducing-total-price-display-and-updating-guest-checkout/
Seems AirB‚ÄônB is at least trying to tackle some of the issues.

Day 1 dinner/stay in Cancun downtown

Day 2 rent a car, drive south to Playa del Carmen  probably spend the day on the beach and stay one night here.

Day 3 early drive to Valladolid, pass the day in the city. 

Day 4 early drive to Chichen Itza, spend several hours there possibly return to Valladolid or proceed to Merida

Day 5-8 Merida, I would like to make this sort of our home base for a few days and do some day trips to Celestun, Izamal, etc.

Day 9-13 Holbox relaxing on the beach, quiet relaxing finish to the trip

Day 14 travel home.


Is there anything I'm missing? We're mostly interested in visiting ruins, delicious food, maybe cenotes, some nice beaches and of course the culture. Little/no interest in resort type vacationing. I'm aware that we are skipping over Tulum, my understanding is that it's very touristy and expensive with little in the way of culture save for a few pyramids. Additionally, it is sort of out of the way.

4 days in Vienna Christmas time. Need advice on daylight and nighttime activities,0,zi2e7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zi2e7p/4_days_in_vienna_christmas_time_need_advice_on/,4,1670703585.0,"Hello all,

I'll be in Vienna around Christmast time for 3 days and half, I need some advices, but especially the first listed:

\-I need to divide activities for daylight abd activities for late afternoon/evening, obviolsuly due to cold and absence of light and since I stay not long, I need to optimize the time. Unfortunately of many itinerary proposed on internet for 3/4 days in Vienna, few/none are specific for winter period. If you have any kind of suggestion, like ""this place is best visited in daylight (e.g. garden ecc) or this place is better in the evening (christmas market etc) please tell me.

\-I  will be equally distant from U6 and a tram line 5/37/38. To reach the city center, I would have to change the metro or to walk a bit after the tram. What's the best option? Are the tram reliable and relatively frequent? I don't mind to walk a bit, especially if it's a nice walk in the old town, but that's a thing google cannot help to evaluate: I'm not searching for the most efficient way to travel, rather the most valuable and enjoable. Just want to know if there is something I should consider.

\-I read that there some cheap tickets if you willing to stay standing at Opera House. Is this always true? Are these experience enojable anyway? I would like to attend Magic Flute on Dec 19 but it's too late to buy official ticket. The opera is something like 3 hours and I read that you must queue 2 hours for the ticket, si it may be so much if the experience is not worth.

If you any ANY advice to enjoy Vienna during Christmast time for this short timeframe, please advice!

Thanks!",2022-12-10 22:19:45

I'm trying to travel in February to Thailand. Will I have any problems in going or coming back?

My thought is that I could go into and out of Thailand on the American passport so they won't worry that the other one is expiring, and then to re-enter Germany it seems like I should be okay if the Italian one is SOON expiring, as long as it is not yet officially expired. Anything I'm missing?

arrive in bangkok 2 or 3 days

fly or overnight train up to chiang mai, pai and maybe chiang rai total of 7 or 8 days

something in south thailand, i keep seeing mixed experiences between phuket and krabi/ao nang. some things 
say phuket is to filled with resorts, others say krabi is pretty boring, even seen the food isnt great?

return to bangkok 2 or 3 days and leave

maybe add another country for a quick stop? there's cheaper flights from the us to hong kong, taiwan, and vietnam i think. then go from some other place to thailand.

Im not looking for a beach resort experience, sipping cocktails on a beach isnt really my thing. also in my 30s not trying to party. I think i might skip the full moon party thing, reading its pretty spring break like. not sure what might be a good spot to check out then in the south.

Ayutthaya looked interesting, not sure how it fits in

Are the airplanes and airports a big deal to get through? not to crazy about all the flying it looks like I might have to do, especially if its like get their two hours early, security etc...

looking to try good and interesting food, adventure, hiking, rock climbing looks fun. not to much sightseeing. not trying to listen to house music lol

I'm planning a \~7 day Italy trip in March (first time), and am trying to squeeze in a trip to either the Italian Alps or Dolomites during that time.

I was thinking maybe we fly into Milan (subject to change if anyone has a better idea) and then either spend the night there, or shoot immediately up to the mountains.

I honestly loved Thailand so much that I wanna go there again but that would be stupid, especially cause I want to **explore the world**, I'm sure I will go there again eventually but not anytime soon. 

**Anyways, what are some countries you recommend I should visit next?** On the top of my head, I was thinking of Japan but I'm open to suggestions :) 

IM ALSO OPEN TO MULTI-CITY/COUNTRY TRIPS! so I can do like 1 week somewhere and 1 week somewhere else type of stuff.

I will explore Europe for sure one day but just not a priority for me right now. 

Also here is a list of places I do not want to visit for now

* **Russia** (Due to war and what not)
* **North Korea** (I'm sure everyone knows why lol)
* **Australia** (Deadly creatures bugs insects you name it, hate that shit haha)
* **Europe** (Just for now will go later in life for sure)
* **Thailand** (already visited, and definitely will go again later in the future)
* **Mexico** (I guess I could do those 1-week resort things but just heard it overall lame and dangerous, its a maybe for now)
* **Pakistan/India** (Just not my vibe for now, maybe in the future)
* **Dubai** (actually been here before but with family, will go back for sure but its also sort of like Europe where you need a good amount of money to enjoy and since Iv already been here I will skip it for now until later in life)
* **United States** (it's right beside me and not really in the mood to visit it for now lol)
* A few more countries but not worth mentioning, I will just wait for your guy's suggestions and go from there, sorry for rambling on and if I sound picky but it is what it is, let me know where I should visit next. :)",2022-12-10 17:08:01

4 days in Lombok + secret gilis

 
4 days on the gili islands


That leaves us with 3 full days remaining. I was thinking about the Komodo islands for snorkeling but with having to fly there and pay $250 for the entrance fee, I'm wondering if it's worth it to do. We are mainly into snorkeling, adventure sports and nature sights. Is the snorkeling off of the komodo islands far superior to what we will find in the other islands?

We are concerned about having too many travel days since I have read that it can be slow and unpleasant, and apparently the fast boat no longer goes from the gilis to Bali anymore.

Side question.. how much do women need to cover up on the beach on gili islands and Lombok? Are they more strict than Bali? Can I wear shorts and a bikini top or do I need to cover up  down to my knees?

But within a few minutes of my review submission, I received a damaged property reimbursement request in the amount of \~2900 Lira (\~$160) for a supposedly broken toilet seat cover. I declined the request immediately as we did no such damage and didn't see the damage when we were there. I consider myself lucky for the host didn't hate me enough to cause real damage to his own property to scam me, he sent pictures showing toilet cover half-loosened (like someone unscrewed half of seat cover). Airbnb is reviewing and i told my side of the story and haven't heard back.  My boyfriend wish I didn't bother to review or at least not submit it so soon, which I agree as It's just unnecessary stress when we are still travelling. So wait for a few days better 14 days if you have an unflattering review to submit.",2022-12-10 16:17:09

Has anyone used the e-gates after being refused pre-settled status? Will I get flagged if I do?

Finished my visit, went back to my country to work and now I want to come back for Christmas to the UK.

Can I use the e-gates even if I have that information in my immigration history or I will get flagged by them? Anyone else in this situation?

"I've been given the kindest gift of my life, and now I need relaxing recommendations for Thailand",0,zhtiem,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhtiem/ive_been_given_the_kindest_gift_of_my_life_and/,4,1670681512.0,"Sappy backstory that you can skip if you like -


For the past year I've been struggling a lot with my mental health. I've been on sick pay/benefits whilst trying to manage a long term stress reaction, which has given me issues both mentally and physically. I've struggled with similar things for most of adulthood, but this past year has left me unable to work, and generally functioning badly. Unfortunately this has also meant an extremely tight financial situation, only worsen significantly by the current world economy and inflation. The stress of paying for food and medicine, finding affordable housing and dealing with ""the system"" and the constant pressure to get back on my feet has left me extremely tired and dissillusioned with life and society. 




Someone seeing me from the outside, would probably never think this. I am a 27 year old woman, in Scandinavia. I dress presentably (when I go outside), I am well spoken and articulate and since losing a bunch of weight, due to stress, I guess I'm considered conventionally attractive (this is completely irrelevant to my case, except for how much harder you have to work to convince others that you are struggling)





Obviously my personal finances are abysmal, and I've had to rely heavily on family to make ends meet, which I am very privileged to be able to, but also very uncomfortable with. When recieving the benefits I do, I am not entitled to any money I make or receive outside of the sick pay. 





Christmas time especially is stressful - trying to handmake presents for everyone so I don't feel like the worst person when they inevitably give me presents I've kindly asked not to receive. Traveling with, to and from family, and the cost associated, and obviously the long, cold, days are all taking yet another toll on me.




I realise that I sound like I pity myself enormously, and honestly - by now I do. It's been a hard life, and an incredibly hard year, and some days I am surprised I am still here. Other people have it worse, but that doesn't make me any better. 





By now, maybe you can tell the kind off state I've been in.



Then yesterday, I received a text from my dad 



""Hey, by chance, do you want free return tickets to Thailand between New Years and end of January""
 


Uuuuuuuuuuuh, what. 



Turns out, a family friend had a trip planned with her partner, but they have broken up, and she no longers wants to go. Instead of refunding or selling the tickets, she immediately thought of me, and figured that I deserved a holiday. When I read this, I started weeping in the middle of the street. Obviously it is an extremely generous offer, but just the fact that she thought of me before anything else makes me feel so seen and understood, for the first time in a very long time. 



All of this backstory may be irrelevant to some, but I wanted to paint the picture of the mindspace I'm in, and also tell the story of this wonderful, wonderful person, who I will forever be grateful for 



--------------------------------------------------------------


(If you've skipped the introduction, basically I've been giftet free return tickets to Thailand for a month)


So now to the actual requests -


Obviously the tickets are not the whole trip, and it will take the cutting of some heels and toes, but ultimately I've calculated that I am able to go, and afford the trip. 


That being said, the cheaper the better, since I do have to return to my actual life again upon return. 


Luckily seeing as am mostly hoping to relax and enjoy the culture and nature, I will not need a big budget for tours, trips and parties, although obviously I am not denying that I might engage a little in these things. 



It may be worth noting that I have several years of experience solo backpacking from when I was younger, and so I have the gear and some know-how.



I've drawn up my travel keywords to - Beach, nature, quiet, friendly, slow, sustainable 



I am looking for specific advice and recommendations from experienced travelers and locals, on where to go, and what to do.



- I have researched some work exchange options, so as to save on accommodation, but my experience tells me to hold off on making any arrangements before am I am actually in the country. Does anyone have any advice or experience with this? 





- I thought a lot about whether I'd prefer mountains or beach, and decided beach for now, so I am think of going south - perhaps Krabi/Phuket area, as the Full Moon scene isn't exactly my crowd for now. 
Any advice on specific areas to go to - I realise everyone wants ""off the beaten path"", and as a tourist you will end up in ""touristy"" areas, but seeing as I am not the target audience for many of the tourism offerings, where else could I go? I also am aware that the Thai beaches and such suffer from tourism, so I'd like to at least try not to contribute to overcrowding of certain areas too much ( I am part of the problem, I know)





- I will most likely be flying into Bangkok on the 30th of December. Should I stay in Bangkok for new years and find a party (through a hostel or such), or should I hurry up get to the south in time for NYE on the beach? I am open to both, but would love recommendations, or to know if others are in the area





- As I have a whole month, I will have time to potentially explore several parts of the country. Would anyone recommend this, or to stay in one area?





- Lastly I am fully aware that I have a very Eat-Love-Pray-mentality around this trip, and that backpacking is not always relaxing - but if anyone has a recommendation for a beautiful, not too crowded, cheap and simple place, I can settle in, and spend a month more or less reading, doing yoga and eating fresh fruit on the beach, without having to sell my liver, I would appreciate it greatly - and feel free to send me resources or links to places or people that could be relevant




Thank you so very much in advance, and if no one sees this, at least it was nice to write it all down.",2022-12-10 16:11:52

Met up with her for some food, hung out on the beach, laughed a lot (one of the few girls I've met who truly enjoyed laughing and even was easy to make her laugh, as she enjoyed it a lot. Though she did say I was a good one who could make her laugh). Had long late night conversations where she opened up about a lot of things, which felt like something real finally. At that moment I knew I was gonna have a crush on her (but not fall in love). I felt like I was reading a story or watching a movie. And I knew I was going to miss it. The night ended with something special in her apartment. 

We continued spending time together for a couple more days and finally it was time for me to leave the island. She met up one last time in the morning to give me a kiss and a hug. I felt sad. Very happy, but sad. She sent her last message as I was taking off. ""Thank you for all"".

I‚Äôm on the plane flying back home. What an amazing experience I had! All the shopkeepers and waiters were nice and patient with our horrible French. The food were great. The museum was awesome. The architecture and scenery were breathtaking. People were genuinely happy when I attempted to speak French. The streets were mostly safe*. We stayed west of the Eiffiel tower and walked around the Lourve area. We also visited the arc and Monmartre. 

* My only negative experience was some man walked up to me and reached out his hand trying to touch my fur jacket. I ran and he shouted some stuff to me in French. Then another guy just chatted with me in a mix of French and English and offered me weed me while I was sitting at the bench to take a break from walking. All this happened on pont des arts and Rue de Rivoli.

Peru: Recommendations and Advice!,2,zhqabb,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhqabb/peru_recommendations_and_advice/,5,1670671678.0,"Hi everyone I was hoping to get some help with a few questions I have pertaining to Peru and the Inca tail. At the bottom I have included a TL;DR as I didn‚Äôt realize how lengthy this was going to end up.  

Hiking the Inca Trail to Maccu Piccu is on my bucket list and I figured that I would start planning this trip for this upcoming April/May. I have looked through a few different posts on this subreddit but still wanted to make my own post.  

I have previously walked the Camino de Santiago (Frances route ‚Äì including crossing the pyrenees) but that was in 2018 and mostly more of a walk than a hike per say. I am now a 27F that trains and competes in Olympic weightlifting. I will be incorporating some inclined walking/stair stepper into my training as I no longer train for stamina and believe I will need some help in that area. I was wondering if any others who have completed it followed any specific training or felt that it was needed? I do live at an elevation of just below 550m ‚Äì quite the difference from peak elevation along the trail.  

I have seen a few different guide options that have been suggested. I was thinking about maybe going with G adventures but am definitely open to other suggestions. I know G adventures offers the option to be met in Lima and then head to Cusco together... but I was originally thinking of making my way to Cusco alone after flying into Lima. Would this be safe? I have traveled extensively through (mostly western) Europe but this will be my first time to South America.  

Following the Inca Trail and heading back to Cusco I was thinking about also hiking up to see Rainbow Mountain since I will be in the area and already (hopefully) acclimated to the approximate elevation. Does anyone have recommendations on which group to book with to do this? I was thinking about maybe AB Expeditions since they leave early and try to arrive ahead of crowds but maybe there are better options.  

Finally, because I will have three weeks off work, I would be open to including a trip down into the Amazon Jungle from Cusco. Have others found this worth it? This could potentially be my only chance to visit Peru (the world is large and I want to see/do so much) and I want to make the most of it. 

Thank you for any recommendations or insight you may have into this subject! 

 

TL;DR 

How fit were you before/did you implement a specific training program 

Tour guide recommendations for Inca Trail  

Is it save to travel around alone as a single female e.g from Lima to Cusco 

Guide recommendations for Rainbow Mountain hike 

Is the Amazon Jungle worth going to

Are there any other need to see/do places or things

Planning and budgeting a gap year,1,zhpa2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhpa2b/planning_and_budgeting_a_gap_year/,4,1670668493.0,"Hey everyone, I'm 17 and from the UK, I've known for a very long time that I'm taking a gap year because I may be looking forward to uni but I love travelling and need a break from education too.

Now that I'm starting to look into planning it at least with a vague itinerary it's very daunting. I was extremely split between Asia and South America but I think I want to do Asia because I get the feeling I'll be better doing South America when I'm more experienced with traveling and know what to be looking out for.

with this in mind, I also think I may go to a European country first, I think starting off in somewhere in Europe will ease me into solo travel a bit better and I really wanna go to certain places like Portugal anyway.

But really what I'm asking is how do I plan this on as small a budget as possible, I'd say I have about ¬£4000 to spend, and it seems like flights take up a huge amount of that, surely there's some tricks to getting cheaper flights to somewhere like Thailand? I know that you can get by in South East Asia on a small budget and that exactly what i want to do but the flights seem like a massive amount, in an ideal world I'd love to go to Australia whilst I'm over in SE Asia since it's a much more convenient opportunity than going from the UK but I simply don't think I've got the budget for that 

any advice on how to start planning and how best to budget for my gap year will be really appreciated.

     ‚Ä¢ 19th ‚Äî exploring Paris

     ‚Ä¢ 29th ‚Äî free day
     ‚Ä¢ 30th ‚Äî free day

     ‚Ä¢ 1st ‚Äî flight home

I plan to stay in Paris through a youth hostel to help with the cost of everything. Should I plan to stay in the other cities as well?

As of right now I have a general idea of the food/drink prices in Paris through a friend, and the event alone will take at least $800 for me to do everything I want to do.

What are everyone's thoughts? Any advice/tips?

South America (Bolivia) first time,3,zhasyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zhasyc/south_america_bolivia_first_time/,1,1670624970.0,"Hello,

I'm looking to go to Bolivia and stay there for a while but I haven't been outside of Europe before.

I have a couple of questions regarding the requirements that I need to meet.

* Do I need to show a return ticket as well on arrival to be allowed into the country? I don't know how long I will stay for so I would like to buy it while I am already there and when I feel like it.
* Do I need a yellow fever or any other vaccinations? I know they are recommended but are they mandatory? I read that yellow fever vaccination is only mandatory when you go to Bolivia from a country that has yellow fever (Brazil, Peru). I plan to stay in Bolivia only. Also in case that my flight to there would go through Sao Paulo, Brazil for instance then does it already count as going to Bolivia from a high risk country? Or does it not count because I will just be in the airport for a couple of hours long layover.
* And for the ""big 19"" it is only necessary to show the PCR or antigen test? Where can I do these? Is it possible to do them in airports or is that more expensive? Due to layovers the entire trip may take even 40 hours. What if I do it early and the 72 or 48 hours ends maybe right before my flight from Brazil to Bolivia?
* I may be going very soon if everything works out perfectly. Does someone know good ways or tips to finding cheap last minute plane tickets?

Thank you for your time and I wish you a dazzling rest of your day.",2022-12-10 00:29:30

Frontier Airlines lol,0,zh8eei,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zh8eei/frontier_airlines_lol/,3,1670619173.0,"TLDR; Never fly Frontier.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
ME: So as a customer, I should be tracking all of the associated cost changes for flights that you cancel and inform the ticket agent to review my receipts
 
FRONTIER: Yes‚Ä¶
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-



FRONTIER: Thank you for your patience. You are contacting us regarding refund. I‚Äôll be more than happy to assist you. Let me take a look at your reservation first, one moment.
 
ME: My flight was cancelled (DCA-LAS) after I made the seat purchases. I noticed after getting my new ticket (BWI-LAS) that they didn't account for my seat purchase. I'm looking to get a refund for the seat on that flight. I also see a negative balance on the app via my account for $10. It sums up to $60 refund (-$10 balance and $50 for the seat BWI-LAS). Are you able to help me with this?
 
ME: To clarify, I was given a random seat for BWI-LAS when I purchased a seat prior to the cancelation on my original flight.
 
Frontier: I am sorry but we cannot process refund for the bags and seats. As per bag policy, bags are nonrefundable. You may refer online to https://www.flyfrontier.com/travel/travel-info/bag-options/ for more information about bags. Especially the flight was already in boarded status.
 
ME: No need to refund the bag as I did check my bag... However, my original flight was canceled. When the ticket counter rescheduled my flight they gave me a random seat, when I previously made a specific seat purchase. Thus I never sat in a seat I selected.
ME: Also, there is a negative $10 balance in my frontier app. For the $10 balance.... Seats $104 + Bags $107 = $211. I was charged $221. This is because the original flights from DCA-DEN DEN-LAS was cancelled. This must be a remaining balance for the difference in price of the seat purchase to when it changed to a nonstop flight (BWI-LAS).
 
FRONTIER: As per checking, the $221 was the one you paid for the bags an dseat after you book the ticket not after the changes.
 
ME: Additionally, the cost of the seat for BWI-LAS is $50... They cancelled my original flight that I paid seats for, gave me a new flight (BWI-LAS) and still kept the paid seat on my bill. I never sat in a seat I paid for. Why would I pay extra for a random seat.
ME: Correct, I was charged $221 for bags and seats. I should only be charged $161 ($28+$26 (Seats) +$56+51 (Bags))
 
FRONTIER: I understand. You need to approach an airport agent about your request refund since w eno longer have any other options since you already took the flight.
 
ME: Why would I travel to an airport and pay $20 to chat with an agent.
 
FRONTIER: Because we no longer could not do anything on this since the flight was boarded. You already took the flight. Once a flight is boarded we frontier customer chat service don't have any option for it any longer. The airport will be the one to compensate you or refund it to you.
 
ME: Ok, how about the $10? If the seats and bags were added that only equals $211. I was charged $221
 
FRONTIER: We could not see any $10 credit here on the reservation. That was already forfeited.
 
ME: Thats not really convienent as the Frontier booth is only open 2hrs before a flight and it was Frontier that cancelled the flight.
ME: Currently my bank statement shows a completed (not pending) purchase of $221. I don't see any credit of $10
 
FRONTIER: I understand. However this was already a boarded status of teh flight. Only if it is not boarded yet, we could get more options.
 
ME: So as a customer, I should be tracking all of the associated cost changes for flights that you cancel and inform the ticket agent to review my receipts
 
FRONTIER: Yes, if you already took the flight. The only problem here why we cannot process your request is because the flight was boarded.
 
ME: Is there a phone line or email that can do this? Not sure why I have to go out of my way for a refund that I will have to argue for onsite
 
FRONTIER: We no longer have any phone number. And even if we have an available customer service on the phone, still they could not process it since we do follow the same process and tools.
 
ME: Thats very sad, I'm suprised to see Frontier still operating. I would leave employment from Frontier ASAP if thats the kind of penny pinching policy they have.",2022-12-09 22:52:53

I‚Äôm currently in the middle of preparing things for a visit home to the US from Japan, and it wasn‚Äôt until the last second that I realized that after porting my American phone number to Japan using Google Voice (I have a Japanese prepaid plan here since I‚Äôm living long term), I have no way to get cell reception in the US. I‚Äôm using Google Voice to stay in touch with people back home and conduct business with them using an American number, and the $20 porting cost to use on data seemed like a good deal until recently.

I‚Äôm aware I can port my number to a new service provider for just the month, but it seems annoying to do all of that when I‚Äôm only staying for less than a month, and then they might try to keep my number for a few months anyways before they‚Äôll let me port it back to Google Voice.

Even so, I figured it‚Äôs time to see if there are phone plans that I can use that will give me coverage within the US but also not hit me with any penalties or cancellations for having my phone abroad. I‚Äôm open minded when it comes to budgets as well since I used to have both T-Mobile and au at the same time here in Japan. Eventually, T-Mobile warned me that they would soon penalize and cancel my entire plan and phone number if I didn‚Äôt re-enter the United States soon, so I had to port my number to Google Voice and abandon my plan with T-Mobile.

I absolutely need both numbers to work on my phone at all times regardless of how long I visit home or stay in Japan. I‚Äôll turn off my Japanese data when I‚Äôm in the states and just use my US data as is usual, and I‚Äôll prioritize my Japanese SIM data when I‚Äôm in Japan. I use an iPhone 13, I might upgrade to the iPhone 14, if that makes a difference.

Is there an easy guide for Americans to quickly learn road rules in Germany and Austria? I never drove in Europe, and I know some basic things (like white lane markings and different signs), but I am sure there is more to it.

And if there is no such guide, is it an option to take, say, a British or Irish driver's manual (and switch sides ofc), or there is actually a significant difference between regions in Europe?

Thank you.

P.s.: judging by downvotes, it may look like a dumb/lazy question, but really I saw several guides completely overlook things even I know. And they are all very basic. For example, in the U.S. & Canada, the default right of way in the absence of yield signs is different from that in Europe. Most articles I found overlook different road markings. In the USA, you can turn left over a double solid line; you only can't turn around or overtake. In Europe, you can't do either. Americans use yellow color to denote the separation of sides of roads, and Europe uses yellow color to denote temporary markings (like road work). Traffic light rules are entirely different. But these are the things I just randomly happened to know. There has to be some resource to learn the differences.",2022-12-09 20:39:19

It also helps that some colors are on sale so it would be much cheaper than a nice Monos suitcase and I don't see myself needing the protection of a hard-shelled bag. 

Other than wheels, would I lose anything by going with the duffel? Also does anyone know if the next size up (55L) would comfortably fit into the overhead compartment of most airlines?",2022-12-09 20:34:27

13 days Europe itinerary advice,1,zh2xq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zh2xq4/13_days_europe_itinerary_advice/,9,1670606423.0,"Hello everyone, I and my family are planning a Europe trip from late January to early February. Our main goal is to visit the places where part of my family has studied before and where I'm studying. My family said they're okay with not getting to know each city deeply as they understand it is quite packed already. The big cities are Budapest, Prague, Berlin, and Amsterdam. While the study towns are Braunschweig, Delft, and Gyor.

# Rough Itinerary

26th: Arrive in Budapest in the afternoon, rest for a bit, and tour the city in the evening.

27th: Touring Budapest, and leaving for Prague with a night bus. 

28th: Arrive in the morning in Prague and stay for one night.

29th: Bus/Train to Berlin arrive around noon and stays for one night.

30th: Left Berlin at around 10 for Braunschweig, Braunschweig day trip, continue to Amsterdam from Braunschweig transit in Hanover and arrive around 9 pm.

31st-3th in Amsterdam: Father has a friend there to show and drive us around if needed, and will probably do a few day trips (Delft and Aachen primarily) with a base in Amsterdam.

4th-8th: flight to Budapest and tour with a day trip to where I'm studying (Gyor). We had to stay in Budapest/Hungary for the longest for visa reasons. We are also able to rest here.

9th: flight back to Southeast Asia.

I think the itinerary is too packed, but even after talking to my family about it, they don't budge. If push comes to shove, I'll probably omit Prague and fly to Berlin instead but I'm still not sure about it plus it's my sister's first time in Europe, and I think Prague will be wonderful for her. And because my family will arrive from Southeast Asia, I'm afraid they'll be jetlagged and won't be ready for a night bus, should I move everything back one day? Will that be enough? If you have any other advice please feel free to reply to this post!",2022-12-09 19:20:23

At a mall in Copenhagen, we were told not to file the paperwork until we left Norway for Switzerland, but once in Norway, we were corrected by our tour guide that Norway is not in the EU and that we should have filed before leaving Denmark. 

So we ended up filing it at the Zurich airport before leaving Switzerland. Person at the customs kiosk seemed like all was in order and even offered to mail it for us. So we thought all was good. We both bought watches there and I got a few clothes so the refund would have been several hundred at least.

My plan is to land in Barcelona and then catch a train to Montpellier and spend a few nights there. After that I want to head to Marseille for a  few nights, then spend a night in Nice before taking a flight home.

Arles (Nature Reserve?)

We made a final decision to book our trip to Jordan for a week in April. But after reading article after article, I am having a hard time deciding how long we should spend at Petra. We plan to be there on the second day of our journey. On day one we plan on arriving to Queen Alia's Airport @ 4PM. Then we are hoping to rent a car then take our time to drive to Wadi Musa. We ideally hope we will be renting a car from the airport (heard it was relatively easy). 

The next morning, hopefully earlier rather than later, we want to be on the ground at Petra. We really can only spend a day here with everything that we are wanting to do. But in terms of hiking/sites we are overwhelmed by what there is to do. 

We know we definitely want to take the visitor center to The Treasury or known as ' The Main Trail'. Then we wonder how difficult the Treasury Viewpoint is and if it's easy enough then should we do it while we're at The Treasury the first time or should we just wait until we come back from whatever trail? 

From the Treasury we are not sure if we would want to go to the High Place of Sacrifice Trail or continue on towards the Wadi Farasa Trail. Or if we should even continue after we do The Main Trail? 

Then would most people say it is worth working our way towards The Monetary Trail or should we stop at whatever our decision is from the Prior Trails. 

Either way, as we have our trip planned out on paper, is we would end up in Wadi Rum towards the evening time. We do not plan on doing anything in particular except for sleeping, enjoying a Bedouin dish, enjoying some tea, and relaxing at whatever camp site we decide. Unless Reddit commenters suggest we skip Wadi Rum, but we have seen that it is a must do area of the Middle East.",2022-12-09 16:30:24

Here‚Äôs what I am thinking. I arrive in Lisbon on Sunday. Relax and do some sight seeing. 

On Monday, stay in Lisbon and visit some of the cool places that people have recommended in other threads and through google search. 

On Tuesday, visit Sintra and its attractions and Cabo de Roca. Should I do this myself or take a day trip on a guided tour to also see Cascais ?

On Wednesday, I want to check out Obidos and I would take the train ride up there and back to Lisbon.

On Friday, do more sightseeing in Lisbon before leaving on Saturday.

&#x200B;

I want to travel to Lombok and the Gilli Islands but I need your recommendations. 

I travel from Singapore, I was wondering if I should take a plane to Denpasar and stay a few days in Bali before going to Lombok by Ferry, then stay a few days in Lombok and then take a boat for the Gilli, and after a few days come back to Lombok to take the plane back for Singapore. My trip would last a week in February by the way.  


I have a list of questions:

\- Should I go to Bali before Lombok?

\- Do you have any hotel recommendations there? Please note that I don't party, don't eat pork, and would like to discover the beaches around and do fun stuff like scuba diving.

\- Which Gilli Island should I go to? 

\- What are the things I have to know before going to these places?

I am going a solo Europe trip in January and hoping to cover Paris, Switzerland and Italy over 16 days. I am looking for your advice, suggestions and opinions on my current plan outlined below:

* 30 Dec'22 - 4th Jan'23: Explore Paris
* 4th Jan: Travel to Zurich and stay at Lucerne
* 5th: Check out Interlaken
* 6th: Visit Grindelwald and Jungfrau region; back to Interlaken

After this I am a bit confused on whether I should go to a) Zermatt and take the Glacier express to St Moritz OR b) go to Chur and take the Bernina express to Tirano, Italy.

I feel that 8 hour journey from Zermatt to St Moritz might be too much take in on one day and St Moritz in itself doesn't seem that exciting to me. Moreover, going to Italy from St Moritz after the Glacier express doesn't look straightforward. Thus, I am inclined towards option b).  However, I would really like to hear your thoughts on this!

* 7th: Travel from Interlaken to Chur and explore it a bit
* 8th: Take Bernina express from Chur to Tirano and explore Tirano afterwards
* 9th: travel from Tirano to Florence
* 9th, 10th and 11th:  Explore Florence
* 12th, 13th and 14th: Explore Rome
* 15th: Flight back home

I enjoy hiking, scenic outdoors, cute cafes, vegan/vegetarian food and walking around pretty towns. I'm super flexible with my current plans and not too worried about budget either. I am female traveling alone so safety is one thing I do want to prioritize. So, please let me know what you think of this itinerary and share any suggestions to make it better.

Looking for itinerary advice for Italy in early July!,1,zgk7u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zgk7u0/looking_for_itinerary_advice_for_italy_in_early/,6,1670552817.0,"Hello! I‚Äôm looking for advice on which destinations in Italy to choose for early July. 

For context:
- timing is non-negotiable, it has to be July for a variety of reasons (mainly timing of fertility treatments that will be out of our control) 
- I know it will be hot and crowded due to high tourist season
- I have been to Rome, Florence, Bologna, and Venice (a long time ago in college, on a very strict budget); my wife has never been to Italy 

We will have about 8 days‚Äîlanding on a Saturday morning, departing the following Sunday. 

Given our limited time, we only want to choose two stops. Priorities are a combo of sightseeing and relaxation, which we feel like we could get at any of these locations.

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre thinking of as options:
- Florence and Cinque Terre
- Venice and Lake Como
- Rome and the Amalfi coast (hoping for specific recs here, thinking we might add a third stop if we go with amalfi‚Äîsome combo of Sorrento/Ischia/Capri/Positano)

We‚Äôre open to other suggestions as well! We love going off the beaten path, but we don‚Äôt want to rent a car so ideally no complicated airport transfer/places that can‚Äôt be reached by train or bus or not-too-expensive private car hire.

I‚Äôm thinking the weather might be more bearable in the north? Our ideal (in terms of what we‚Äôd like to do) would probably be Rome and Lake Como, but traveling between the two seems like a nightmare, unless anyone has suggestions for this?)

Note that my itinerary consists of two separate airlines: from USA to Sharjah is Qatar Airways, then from Sharjah to India is Air Arabia. I have a single ticket which lists both flights, but it also says that I am responsible for a ""self-transfer"" between the two airlines. 
* If and when I reach the UAE, how likely is it that the immigration officer would actually deny me a visa-on-arrival based on the six months validity rule?
* In case I am not able to get the transit visa, would it be possible for me to just stay airside the whole time, until I can board my onward flight to India? From my research, it seems that the Sharjah airport is very small, and there‚Äôs only one terminal. So, hopefully there would not be any immigration desk in between the gate where I arrive and the gate where I need to depart from. If anyone who has been to the Sharjah airport could confirm this, I would appreciate it so much!

Note that I am not worried about the immigration procedures in India, since I have OCI status which means I am exempt from the six months validity rule as far as India is concerned.",2022-12-09 02:27:53
Dual Citizen living in US Traveling to Canada and back without US passport,0,zgh9j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zgh9j7/dual_citizen_living_in_us_traveling_to_canada_and/,4,1670545541.0,"Hello Reddit,

I am traveling to Canada from the US on Sunday by car and am worried about re-entering the US without a valid US passport. (I'm waiting for it to be sent as I have applied for it)

I have lived in the US my entire life and I recently got a canadian passport and was planning on traveling on that. I'm worried about re-entering the US with a Canadian passport.

I also have supporting documents of:

\- US drivers license

\- Expired US drivers license

\- US College ID

\- A copy of my expired US passport

Im wondering how difficult it will be to enter the US as I'd prefer not to be stuck in Canada. If anyones done this before, please let me know what happened.",2022-12-09 02:25:41
Month in Italy + Switzerland itinerary advice,7,zggtxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zggtxh/month_in_italy_switzerland_itinerary_advice/,5,1670544572.0,"My partner and I are planning to visit London, Switzerland, and Italy for a month in September 2023. He‚Äôs been everywhere in Italy on this list except for Bologna and Puglia (but swears he doesn‚Äôt mind repeating!) and this will be my first time in Italy. He‚Äôs also visited Switzerland before, I have not. This year we took a 3 week trip to Greece that was similarly paced without any issues, put if I‚Äôm packing too much in I‚Äôd love to know. 

I originally planned a few days on the Amalfi coast but swapped that out for time in Puglia to have some beach time, save money, and have a slightly more authentic experience. My family is also (originally) from Puglia so I‚Äôm interested in exploring the area! 

On vacation we love eating good food, strolling, hiking, the beach, history, and some nightlife. 

Shopping is not very important.

My partner has driven abroad and doesn‚Äôt mind driving in Italy outside of major cities.

We hope to visit Venice and the Dolomites together on a separate trip. 

I‚Äôve focused most of my research on the Italy portion of the trip so far, but any ideas or advice for our time in Switzerland are more than welcome! I used to live in London so I‚Äôve got those days covered.

South East Asia Itinerary - seeking feedback and advice,3,zggrm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zggrm7/south_east_asia_itinerary_seeking_feedback_and/,10,1670544426.0,"I will be traveling with my significant other to SE Asia for the first three weeks of February and would love your help with what we are planning.

We are flying from California into Singapore to start our trip to visit old friends and plan on staying with them for two days before continuing our trip. Our return flight is from Bangkok. In between we plan on spending time in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand.

We have never traveled to Asia before, but we are experienced travelers in other areas of the world (Central and South America, Europe, etc). There is so much to see, but I want to make sure we are choosing the right spots and not ""over doing it"".

For some context on how we usually travel: We are both very active and like to see a lot while traveling. Most of our traveling has a mix of history, nature, foodie tourism, and cultural/artistic sites. We normally stay at AirBnBs and generally avoid large group tours, but I am open to feedback on how best to approach these areas.

After doing research I put together the below mock itinerary. I have been considering removing Chiang Mai or Thai beach/islands and taking more time in other areas we are already visiting. Would this be a mistake - is doing both feasible? If forced to choose between the two which one would you pick? There are many other areas I wish we could spend more time in, but there is already a lot of jumping around as is.

Does anyone have any feedback on changing anything with this plan? Any destinations you would add/remove?

2/1 wed - fly (flight to singapore is already booked)

2/2 Thurs - fly/arrive

‚Öî Fri - singapore (staying with friends)

2/4 sat - singapore

2/5 sun - travel to hanoi (AM flight). This is probably the city/area I am most interested in visiting due to the really positive feedback we received from friends who have gone here.

2/6 monday - hanoi

2/7 tues - day trip from hanoi (ninh binh possibly?)

2/8 wed - ha long bay (2.5-3 hr bus ride from hanoi)

2/9 thurs - ha long bay, return to hanoi

2/10 fri - travel from hanoi to siem reap (we are very excited to see angkor wat)

2/11 sat - siem reap/angkor wat

2/12 sun siem reap/angkor wat

2/13 mon - travel from siem reap to chiang mai

2/14 tues - chiang mai

2/15 wed - chiang mai (would a day trip in this area make sense? any recommendations? \*edit - I meant to ask a day trip outside of chiang mai, but in the surround area. Sorry for any confusion\*)

2/16 thurs - travel

2/17 fri - thailand - beach/island (Have seen a lot of different places recommended - like Koh Kood, Krabi, Koh Samui, Koh Samet. Would love your thoughts on this.)

2/18 sat - thailand - beach/island

2/19 sun - AM travel to bangkok

2/20 mon - bangkok

2/21 tues - AM fly to US

Beyond the planned itinerary, any tips or advice on this trip would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!",2022-12-09 02:07:06

Comment,1,j0o6eur,,0,1671335556.0,"This super sucks, and I'm sorry you're in this situation.

I've also learned the hard way that travel insurance covers ""stuff that happens to you AFTER it happens to you"" and NOT ""stuff you decide not to do even if it's for good and sound reason."" Most travel insurance policies consider making personal safety decisions to fall into the latter category. 

But read your policy! I'm not sure if Expedia's coverage is an add-on that provides minimal coverage or if you got a more robust plan. That said, I always buy the ""robust plan,"" to the tune of a couple hundred dollars for every trip, and those don't cover civil unrest unless it renders lodging uninhabitable or results in the airline cancelling the flight (which the airline would refund you for anyway). 

I hope you can make use of those airline credits to go somewhere. I'm so sorry. I hope you are blessed with good luck for future travel.",2022-12-18 05:52:36
Comment,1,j0o6adx,,0,1671335493.0,So glad I found this post because I just visited LA for the first time 2 weeks ago. I arrived Saturday morning and Ubered to six flags magic mountain because it‚Äôs one of the best roller coaster parks in the world but sadly over half the rides were closed so it was kinda a let down so don‚Äôt bother with that. From there I ubered to Hollywood walk of fame and walked all the way to Beverly Hills like 6 miles and walked through it and all of that was just beautiful. I even made it to Rihanna‚Äôs mansion. Then I ubered to Santa Monica pier/beach and ate at the bubba gump there. The pier was beautiful at night. I got a hotel around there last minute for 240. Next morning I checked out the beach again which didn‚Äôt have much going on since it‚Äôs the winter season although it was still pretty. Then I ubered south like 55 minute drive to the USS Iowa battleship museum which is a pretty big ship that you can explore for like 20 bucks. That was pretty cool. Then I had nothing else to do so I started walking back north to the airport to save a bit of money on the Uber I made it like 6 miles on foot and checked out a strip club which was pretty dead inside so I finally ubered to the airport and flew home that Sunday night. I told an Uber drive everything I did he said you did more in 2 days than I‚Äôve done in 24 years living here.,2022-12-18 05:51:33

Comment,1,j0o5tz4,,0,1671335257.0,"December means Christmas Markets in many parts of Europe.. generally, they run through Advent, but it does vary by region/country and city/towns.  Check this years opening dates to get a feel for next year‚Äôs‚Ä¶we‚Äôve done a few ‚Äúfly out on Thanksgiving Day‚Äù trips and found it a little too early for some CM‚Äôs (not open yet), including this past month.

FYI, [this Rick Steves link](https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/travel-classes/monday-night-travel/european-christmas) can give you some insight.

We‚Äôve done this sort of trip several times; we‚Äôre museum buffs, so our general strategy is to hit a museum in the morning, hit a CM for a quick lunch break, more general sightseeing in the afternoon (maybe through another CM if it‚Äôs a bigger city with multiple CM‚Äôs), then a break, and then out at dusk to another CM for hot mulled wine & street food dinner & the night ambiance.  FYI, Germany is the classic ‚Äòground zero‚Äô for CM‚Äôs, but there‚Äôs good CM‚Äôs elsewhere too.

For itinerary planning based on 6-10 days, I‚Äôd figure just 1 to 3 locations & in the same region (or fast train connect). Personally, I like 3 night stays before moving on.  If you pick bigger cities, you can skip the cost of a rental car, as mass transit in EU is great.  FYI, reason I started at just one (1) destination location is because if 6 days includes travel time from the US & return, you‚Äôre looking potentially at having just 4 days, one of which is your jet lag recovery day of arrival.  

Finally, from a planning standpoint, job#1 starts in January: make sure everyone has passports and they‚Äôre not expiring soon.  Get this paperwork submitted by February because you‚Äôll otherwise forget about it & then have to pay extra fees for express handling at the last minute ($$).",2022-12-18 05:47:37

Comment,1,j0o3b54,,0,1671333958.0,"Update:

I found my luggages.

Let me give a background to help put better perspective.

On December 15, 2022 at 12:55pm PT, I boarded the bus from Los Angeles to Oklahoma City with my luggages tagged. We arrived Phoenix, Arizona and transferred to another bus by 9:40pm MST (This was my first time transferring, I honestly did not realize I had to move my two boxes to the other bus, technically, my luggages were still in the first bus as I never touched it.)

Upon arriving OKC, I realized the ugly reality. Rushed to the information center of the OKC station. The attendant casually told me to call Phoenix station, and asked me to check Google for the contact.

I‚Äôm not going to lie, after filing the claim, I dialed the number countless times, and I kept being returned to the Booking department and they were very much helpless as they could not do much as they were not in the station physically; some customer service specialist even suggested I return to Phoenix, that was some news that put some anxiety on me, the fact I would even return was not a guarantee I will find my luggages.

After much persistence, I was able to get a direct contact at the Phoenix station in the Baggages Department, it must have been some grace of sort, as one customer service specialist provided me with the contact after asking for permission. Although, the Baggages department told me they could not find my luggages at the station on three different attempts, they could not tell me whether it was already on the next bus. It was not inspiring, honestly.

However, intuitively, on December 16, 2022, I decided to monitor the next bus coming down to OKC from Phoenix, not out of certainty but just to utilize all options. I got to the station after its arrival and found my luggages there on December 17, 2022 by 11:30 am CST. All items were intact, and nothing had been tampered with. Got my bags and left.

Recommendations:

Ensure luggages are tagged at the first point of departure.

Contact the last station you think the luggage was lost. Although, you can go to the station too.

Look out for the next bus, it might just be on it. Also, understand that I never removed my box or put it in the park and forgot it. It was still on the bus, so, this may have been some factor.

I am sorry that others have not found theirs, I am hopeful that you willüôèüèæ.

That being said, I'll be dress shorts and polo shirt in the lounge and boarding, then change into gym shorts and t shirt for the flights themselves. I also think it feels good to change back into 'nicer' clothes getting off the plane, meeting relatives, transiting to hotel or the likes.

i loved just exploring around and meeting people, everyone in greece was just so lovely and friendly. be mindful when picking your hotel or airbnb however because we chose to stay in malia but it gets a bit crazy at night, lots of parties and drunk people, which is totally cool if thats your scene but it can be a bit much.

we were pretty out of the way, id totally recommend yiannis mannos hotel if youre looking for a quiet and scenic place to stay. it was pretty cheap to stay in, the rooms werent much but they were very clean. the pools were lovely, the staff are amazing there, they just absolutely cant do enough for you. the foods amazing aswell. as i said its pretty out of the way of everything , so you need to walk into town but the route is so charming, theres a chicken farm right next to it, and a lovely little family owned greek restaurant. theres lots of places to rent a car or bike nearby if youd like to drive around too

Comment,1,j0nud7w,,0,1671329517.0,"Lufthansa first is a step above any business class I've ever flown. They even great your dog by its name. 

You get escorted from check in to security. There you have a private room to take off your jacket and an employee carries your bin. From the private room, they take you to the front of the security line. Then they escort you to a special lounge where food and service are excellent. Then you get escorted to the plane so you don't have to wait in line with all the  business class low lives. 

At night, they add a mattress pad to your seat (though I believe Emirates does that even in business class). Food is really good, I have no idea how they manage that in the air. 

I think they have like 2 flight attendants for the 4 1st class seats, so service is excellent. Not like business where you have to get your own snacks and often don't get a drink during boarding. 

Emirates business picks you up at home, I don't think Lufthansa first has that service included.

Nobody cares what you wear. People just want to sleep and get home. Not show off or judge. 

Only problem is that Lufthansa first is not available on most airports (and most plane configurations). 

IMO it's totally worth it if you fly very regularly and you're bored/annoyed/tired of business class. If you've never flown business, business is probably exciting enough.",2022-12-18 04:11:57

I suggest staying in Barranco over Mira Flores in Lima if you like the artsy and tbh recently ""gentrified"" scene. But it's so cute lolol

Spend more time in Cusco than Lima.
We organized our travel ourselves.  Might be worth it to go through a tour company for Macchu Picchu because it was a bit confusing organizing everything for us.  Definitely get a tour guide for Macchu!  We learned so much about it and appreciate it more than we would have without one.

For first / business class the airline and plane type matters.  If you are flying on United, it might be a 757, which is not as sexy as flying in a large widebody.  

From where you are flying from, the lounges can be extremely nice, and you could have a very tasty meal / drink before leaving.  You must find a Polaris lounge.  

IF you are flying from the East Coast, flight might be really short, and not able to enjoy the lie flats.  

First class is a dying breed.  I know BA has it still.  The Lufthansa first class experience is legendary, with their own ""terminal"" at Frankfurt.  But I wouldn't get 3 hours of happiness of flying that far.

Buses were great to get for short journeys.

Venice was possible however you are restricted with not many bridges offering alternatives to steps. You can use the water buses however there is a step on and off but staff assisted.

Lake Garda was generally good where we visited.

The biggest consideration is those who are pushing and hot temperatures. Because we went in height of summer temperatures were around 35-40 degrees. It was best visiting during mornings and on evenings when temperatures were cooler. Have plenty of water on you and sun cream.

The general advise is to climb slow. That is increase your sleeping altitude no more than 300m a day when above 2500m altitude and have a regular acclimatization day.

Comment,2,j0n4fw5,,0,1671317325.0,"Depending on where you are going you can choose your international flight to have a longer layover as a buffer or hedge against delays. AC does 2-3x daily to LHR, FRA and other international hubs for example. If you can't get the AC search engine to give you a longer layover you can sometimes get more connection options in a google flights search then click through to book directly with AC, or as a last resort you can call in and book over the phone, feeding the agent flight-by-flight for what you want.

Weather is a real risk, not sure if that helps you decide. Flights into Bangor could just as easily be delayed (or affected by weather at the hub the plane is coming from). It's generally true that you need to watch weather as you get into last 2-3 days. Usually you can rebook for free so consider if you have the flexibility to leave a day earlier or later if you happen to get a storm in the forecast as you get down to t-2. Better to rebook and have predictability than roll the dice and have to take a hotel unplanned. No airline will put you up if an airport shuts down for weather. 

AC does have delays or cancellations for other reasons but I don't think they are more or less common than any other airline. 

There are relatively few flights into Freddy (meaning delays are measured in days not hours), but again, unless you're driving to Boston it's probably a similar trade-off either way.",2022-12-18 00:48:45

However, I have been through the border many times, get gas and whatever snacks you need on the US side and don't stop in any border towns in Mexico - it's OK to stop at gas stations along the way.  I like to go to the smaller border crossings to do the immigration/customs paperwork, they tend to be faster, less crowded, and the agents are less stressed out.  Have a very warm blanket, there is always the chance you get stuck on the road for a couple of hours due to a closure or accident -- there are not too many alternate routes in some areas.  Take at least $100 ($1, 5, 10) in smaller denominations for tips or buying small things.  Don't worry about taking a lot of cash, you can get cash from ATMs, it's not worth it going to exchange places.  You can't really use credit cards at gas stations, and if you do use a card, have them bring the card reader to you - don't let the card out of your sight.   
 Don't forget, you don't have friends in Mexico, or anywhere you travel, be apprehensive if anyone approaches you and tries too hard to be your friend.  Go and have a great time!",2022-12-18 00:45:08

Comment,2,j0n0814,,0,1671315453.0,"We are more than a decade older and had not done international travel, which made no sense as everyone we know, even our own now young adult kids had traveled internationally. We intended to start traveling in the spring of 2020 - but of course, everything was canceled. Finally, in mid-2022 we did our first trip to Europe - we chose the Netherlands, for various reasons, spent two weeks there, traveling entirely on our own. Loved the country and the people and would visit there again. For a firsttime traveler, it was helpful that most of the people we interacted with spoke at least some English (English is widely used in the Netherlands). I have some skill in a couple of other languages but not Dutch!

Things I learned with our first trip: I did massive amounts of independent research and prep and planning, which turned out to have been super helpful. But awfully time consuming. But having a set of options pre-planned for each day was great when weather was bad or a museum was temporarily closed.

On our next trip, I probably will not do quite as much planning as I did for the first one. We are now looking at a 2023 trip and are starting our plan by picking a rough time frame and then our flights first, and then adjusting our planned itinerary to fit the flights. We found big pricing differences just moving the start and end dates from days to a couple of weeks.  I recently planned out another trip in detail - only to find we'd have to shift our trip weeks forward, airfares were way higher than expected and many flight options were already booked! We ended up putting this plan aside for another year as we couldn't make it work for us. But I learned a good lesson on that: figure out the flights first!

Am now also using others' suggested itineraries as a starting point and then reading up on venues, attractions, events, locations using online web stuff. Have found Rick Steves' books to be helpful for us and recommend them as one of many resources.",2022-12-18 00:17:33

If my spouse comes with me we always take the owners update (aka sales pitch) and tell them up front that we're just showing up for the incentive (visa card, vouchers, points, etc) and then just keep saying no.  They're always polite, not too pushy and most times get you out on time.   It'll also work just fine for the deal you accepted.  The Resort is in  a great spot of the hotel zone with a small mall and restaurants across the street and grocery store a couple big blocks away.  Bus pickup right out front makes it easy to venture further into downtown (Walmart run).   Pool areas are nice and service is great.

No.

Read your policy first - coups/political unrest/protests/terrorism are typically excluded from a covered reasons.

So you, the customer, decided to cancel (by your initiative) instead of letting the airline/tour operator/etc cancel on you, means that you won't get any refund or credit if that's what the terms were.

Comment,1,j0mdomp,,0,1671305884.0,"If your flight has a delay causing misconnection please call in advance in order for the airline to offer a comfortable solution for you.

As a general advice when booking a flight with a connection pls mind that

\- in winter times delays are perfectly acceptable (everyone's safety is of outmost importance) - as far as I know the EU regulation for compensation does not cover for cancellations and delays caused by weather conditions (I might be wrong - I not an expert here)

\- pls mind in what airport you are transferring (airports like LHR, FRA, DXB etc are huge - give yourself enough time to walk)

\- pls check if a passport check will be required (transferring in FRA you need to know if you are transferring from a non-schengen flight to a schengen flight as additional documents check by immigration is mandatory)

\- pls pay attention at gates and transfer signs - in case of doubt ask someone who is wearing an airline tag or uniform

\- give yourself time to transfer - especially if you are not a frequent flyer or if you are bad with directions. Better wait on a chair than to run through the airport and lose your flight.

&#x200B;

Also - pls check if the airline has some local phone numbers you can contact. Some airlines have hotlines for specific countries so they can help their passengers even more swiftly. Avoid calling USA, Germany (especially for LH), UK phone numbers as there are more ppl flying from there and the waiting time can be quite big, unless you are flying from there.",2022-12-17 21:38:04

If you mean June, then I would forget Ireland/Iceland/Scotland/Scandinavia. The weather can be very ugly there in June. There I would go in July. If you don‚Äôt like rain, forget the latter countries, too. And the northern countries are all expensive. On the other hand you have lots of nature and not many tourists there. 

I‚Äôm from Central Europe and I have been traveling a lot, especially in Europe. My favorite places in the world are Thailand and the Southwest of USA.

In Northern Europe, Norway is maybe the most amazing country. But sometimes it‚Äôs raining there for three weeks continuously, also in summer. 

In western Europe I like France very much, but it is expensive and people are not the nicest on earth if you speak English and not French. Food is incredible there (best in Europe) and the scenery, too.

When I read your text, northern Italy came to mind. Tuscany is full of ancient towns and food is incredible there, too. At the northern part of Lake Garda, mountains meet a great lake. There are hundreds of hiking trails and if you go in June, the northern part is not so crowded. Further in the north, you will find the Dolomites, you can go hiking there for years and the scenery with the mountains and lakes is marvelous.

The ‚ÄúDollar Blue‚Äù is the unofficial rate, which is twice as high as the official rate imposed by the government.

In other words, if you exchange your dollars in an official exchange house or pay with a credit card, those dollars will be worth twice less in pesos than if you exchange them unofficially.

For the latter, you must have your money in cash and exchange it in person with someone once in Argentina.

Either individuals or unofficial exchange houses that you will find in ‚Äòla city porte√±a‚Äô of Buenos Aires, it is easy to find people who want dollars and will exchange them for you at the blue rate (by searching ""Cotizaci√≥n dollar blue Argentina"" in google you will be able to find out how much the rate is that day).

I hope the information helps you.

Have fun in Argentina!",2022-12-17 20:32:50

We went to northern Italy this fall. Avoided all the touristy stuff. Visited Genoa, a beachside town called Camogli. Then went to to Bolzano, saw √ñtzi the iceman, then hiked Seceda. I‚Äôd you are outdoorsy people from Colorado I think you‚Äôll *love* the Alps. We flew out of Innsbruck which is a super underrated but lovely European town with castes and typical European sightseeing that‚Äôs not crowded. Only shopping we did was for hiking boots. 

Food was amazing. Scenery mind blowing. People lovely. At the time we went, (early oct) not crowded at all. Whatever you choose I hope you like it!

Edit to add that the hike was not extreme (like North American hiking can be) so your daughter could totally do it. I‚Äôm 44, not super fit and asthmatic and I did it, just needed a bit longer to catch my breath when going uphill.

Comment,0,j0m2uco,,0,1671301436.0,"I feel this so much.

I backpacked around Europe in my 20's and caught the travel bug HARD. I never got to travel as much as I dreampt about it and still don't as much as I want even though I really have the means to do so.

But i spent a LOT of time dreaming and talking about it, to the point that people would get pissed at me for doing so. My parents, family, friends (who i still talk to) neighbors, wife, etc ALL think I am too obsessed with wanting to travel (specifically to Europe) and don't get why I care for very few other things beyond European travel. They don't understand why a lot of ""normal"" things don't instill the same passion as the thought and action of European travel does for me.

They don't get why domestic travel doesn't even give me that same feeling of excitement or why i'd rather spend money on traveling to Europe than redoing the kitchen or trading in my perfectly fine paid-off car for a new one with a new car payment.

But as I look and talk to each one I realize that not a single one of them, barring my father, has ever spent more than a traditional 1-2 week American vacation to anywhere outside the US or a tropical island. A few of my friends, and my wife, have spent 1-2 weeks in Europe. And I don't think any of them understands what happens when you spend an extended period of time traveling around a place where you are not pressured about being 'home' win 10-12 days.

20+ years later, I find I have very little to talk with to others, unless they have or want to travel and then I can go for hours. Over this time I have started and stopped and started again building a European travel app to help others plan trips and connect with other Europe travelers. I've started to interview other Europe travelers to provide inspiring stories to new and wannabe Eurotrippers, and really to satiate my own desire to talk European travel with others.

It can seem lonely to yourself, and weird to others who don't get it, but wanderlust runs deep and you really can only share it with others who have experienced it. That's why this community, and I hope the one I am building again, are really helpful.",2022-12-17 20:23:56

Comment,1,j0lyjqq,,0,1671299652.0,"Any chance for an open jaw ticket? You are setting yourself up for an unnecessary day of travel by flying round trip at the same city. it may be worth the extra expense, especially on such a short trip. 

I agree with the others who prefer ""the general vibe"" of Sourthern Spain to northern/central BUT intercity travel in southern Spain is not as convenient as the north.

Barcelona and Valencia are not ""bad"" cities in any way. Indeed! the density of the old town area of Barcelona is absolutely mind blowing. 

I'd fly into whichever of Barcelona or Madrid has the cheapest arrival then spend 4 days. Then train to Valencia for 2 days to see the ocean and all of that for a bit. Then train to the other madrid/bcn for the balance and to fly home. 

Maybe also take a day trip to Toledo or Segovia from Madrid.",2022-12-17 19:54:12

I was there in December and Pompeii (highly recommended!) was almost totally empty.

The Italian/Austrian high speed rail and sleeper train system also means that you can combine this with Central European Christmas markets if you like. For instance, you can take an overnight train from Vienna to Milan, Rome, Florence or Venice, and from there take a high speed train to Naples or an overnight train to Sicily.

An alternative to get into Italy is to take the Bernina Express through spectacular Alpine scenery from Chur, Switzerland to Tirano, Italy. From there you can take a regular Italian local train along the shore of Lake Como to Milan.

(When I did this I took the TGV from Paris to Zurich the evening before, spent a night in a hotel in Zurich then took an early morning local train to Chur)

Comment,4,j0lpp4f,,0,1671295946.0,"You're hosed, if your connection isn't delayed too.

Check later departures from Frankfurt to your onward destination on any airline, and make a note of the first 2-3 that leave an hour after you arrive.

When you get there, go to a Lufthansa service desk or agent - preferably the first one you can find - and ask what the rebooking options are. They *should* offer you something reasonable. They are obliged (EU regulation 261/2004 and relevant case law) to book you on the next available flight in similar travel conditions (i.e. same class of travel) or later if you choose. So if there is another airline leaving within a couple of hours with a seat in the same cabin you are booked in while the next LH flight is the next day, they should put you on that other airline.

Knowing the other flights ahead of time means you can specifically ask for them.

Be polite, but insist firmly on your rights if they are not offered to you.",2022-12-17 18:52:26

Comment,3,j0lp0i4,,0,1671295659.0,"I was caught up in a protest a few years ago (also in Peru). Tourism may be vital to that region, but they are fully aware of this and actually use a halt in tourism to force the government to listen. Tourism doesn't only benefit the region; it also benefits the government. When I flew to Cusco, the entire area was shut down for several days. Locals tossed rocks in the roads, burning trees, etc. I eventually got to the start of the Inca Trail after locals saw my driver and guides were locals, but mileage can of course vary.

You could go and everything is fine or you could go and get stuck. It seems like the unrest is unlikely to stop, so I'd put a lot more thought into going or not. I don't think you'd be unsafe by any means - Peruvians as a whole seem nice to tourists in my experiences - but you'd have to be very prepared to be in Peru for the long haul if things get bad again.",2022-12-17 18:47:39

You will need a Schengen short stay visa (not transit visa) should your trip include change of planes at more than one EU airport, that is third country -> EU -> EU -> third country.

Please note, that South African citizens need Schengen short stay visa to enter the EU. That means, without this visa you will be able to change planes, however you wont be allowed to leave the international part of the airport. All international EU airports are physically divided into international and domestic parts.

Japan is extremely safe and transportation is efficient. There are English speaking volunteers at train stations who can assist you if you need help finding the right train stop. In case you get lost, Google maps would be of great help too.

Things could get a bit confusing if it‚Äôs your first time in Japan, but don‚Äôt fret. More and more Japanese are becoming comfortable speaking in English, especially in touristy areas. You‚Äôll find lots of foreigners/expats there who‚Äôd be willing to help you out.

When dining, you can use Google translate to read menus without English translations. Don‚Äôt worry though, a lot of restaurants have simple menus with photos and descriptions in English.

Tokyo is a busy city but you‚Äôll find a lot of wonderful parks and other quiet places there like gardens and temples.

Osaka is worth visiting. It‚Äôs slower than Tokyo but it has a lot to offer like museums and charming neighborhoods.

Kyoto feels like old Japan. Here you can experience tea ceremonies and you‚Äôll find lots of interesting artisan shops.

Nagano is underrated but definitely visit if you want to see snow monkeys. You can hike in Mt. Togakushi and be surrounded by giant cedar trees. It‚Äôs one of my favorite places in Japan.

Public transit is clean and easy. Also recommend Tainan for interesting history and a very different feel from Taipei. There is a surprising amount of nature and mountains with lovely hiking. Taipei is an expensive city, but outside of Taipei the prices are more reasonable. Outside of Taipei, there are definitely fewer English speakers but Google translate helps! My other choice would be Chile - Santiago is a fun city and there are endless possibilities outside Santiago (Valparaiso, wine region, Patagonia). It is a huge country so you can't do it all in one trip. But if you have time and budget, I would highly recommend taking 2-3 days to go to Rapa Nui (Easter Island), one of the most fascinating places and technically part of Chile so it is a domestic flight. It is a long flight but LATAM flies a comfortable 787 daily from Santiago. Our Spanish is very rudimentary but we had no issues in Chile.",2022-12-17 16:46:38
