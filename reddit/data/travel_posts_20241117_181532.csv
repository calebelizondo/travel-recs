xi4qz9,Do not ever visit Egypt,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xi4qz9/do_not_ever_visit_egypt/,19155,"I am an American man who came to visit Egypt, but I felt so extremely unwelcome.

I went to the pyramids of Giza and they were truly majestic, but I couldn't walk more than a few steps without being harassed and hustled by the many of the touts trying to sell things or services. They were trying to sell me camel and horse rides, trying to give me a guided tour, trying to sell me worthless crap trinkets, trying to take my phone from me and take pictures of me and my family and then demanding an absurd amount of money.

One guy that I got on top of his camel for pictures asked for money so I gave him $10 USD and he started yelling and screaming at me asking for $100 USD. I thought he is going to attack me, my family and I just quickly ran away from him.

My family member got her phone snatched and the guy took pictures of her telling her to make all these poses, and then he wouldn't give the phone back to her until she paid him $20 and then he kept complaining about how $20 is nothing and that he deserves more.

One guy came up to me to pose in a picture with me and I told him to go away but he wouldn't. He stayed in the picture while my family member was taking the pictures and then he asked for money, I got so extremely mad and I screamed at him at the top of my lungs to go away. All of the other travelers around there heard and were looking and then only did the guy go away.

Then trying to walk around Giza and Cairo, just forget about it. It's virtually impossible. All of the touts coming up to us and asking if we need a ride, or if we can buy their whatever shit trinkets they are selling. We couldn't walk more than literally 60 seconds without someone new coming to harass us.

What is it about this place that makes visitors feel so unwelcome? Why do they do this? There is so much rich history and culture to Egypt that I am sure everyone all around the world would want to visit, but why do the touts push us away instead of making us feel welcome?

When I came back to the US and all my coworkers asked me how it was, I told them the pyramids and temples were amazing, but the touts were absolutely horrible. I told them not to go, and that I would never step my foot back in Egypt ever again.",2338,2022-09-19 02:10:24,tigerhawk2005,0.87

1epj1jn,Leaving T√ºrkiye heartbroken and feeling like the entire country is set up as a scam,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1epj1jn/leaving_t√ºrkiye_heartbroken_and_feeling_like_the/,15157,"I‚Äôll preface this by saying that my grandmother was born and raised in T√ºrkiye (diplomats). She loved the country, spoke Turkish, and returned nearly every year. She took me there about 20 years ago and as a 12 year old, I really loved it. 

Fast forward these past two decades and I‚Äôm so excited to take my spouse there. I am now sitting at IST feeling completely the opposite. Here is just a small section of why I felt so scammed by nearly the entire experience in only 3 days:

- The airport approved taxi with fixed price tried to rip us off for 3x the fixed price into Istanbul. He locked the doors when I refused to pay the inflated price and threatened to call the police. I managed to get the locked door open and leave the agreed upon payment on the seat. 

- We had the ‚Äútourist price‚Äù menus constantly given to us with massive price gouging. Then when a Turkish friend joined us for dinner, we found out what was happening. Not to mention the constant yelling and cajoling of street scammers trying to get their next victim. 

- My spouse fell for the common shoe shine scam. This is my fault for not warning her so shame on me. She is also the nicest person I know so it feels even worse. But this guy actually ended up reaching into her bag and grabbing her wallet and removing 20‚Ç¨ (all that was in it thankfully) before running off. So aggressive. 

- I wanted to take a photo of the building where my great-grandfather worked. It used to be an embassy, but is now a social club. I was angrily screamed at and told to leave despite being on a public sidewalk. I tried to explain why I wanted a photo using Google translate and the ‚Äúsecurity man‚Äù only screamed more and threatened to call the cops unless I paid him. I just ended up walking away and into the hotel across the street. 
- We just wanted to buy some Turkish delight to take home to my spouse‚Äôs mother. The shop owner charged us 4x what was told to us it would be when he wrapped it up. He threatened to call the cops if we didn‚Äôt pay, so we did, and now I am contesting the charge with the credit card company. We are two women in a foreign country so it‚Äôs not like we are going to keep arguing with some random man we don‚Äôt know.

- Our hotel demanded we pay half our room in cash and were pressuring us at check out to write a ‚Äúfive star‚Äù review online while standing there. Constant two-faced behaviour, especially when the wifi stopped working and the lift went out. 

- Finally, let‚Äôs just even look at this airport. The view that every foreigner is a piggy bank continues. 22‚Ç¨ for a f***ing burger at Burger King even at an inflated airport price is insane. There are not that many places to fill up water bottles either, so I suppose it‚Äôs 10‚Ç¨ for a bottle or just dehydrate yourself! Oh, and want internet? You only get it for an hour and you have to go get a special password! World‚Äôs best airport? Maybe world‚Äôs best scam airport. 

I‚Äôve lived in multiple Global South countries and never have I been so eager to leave a place, even where less developed than T√ºrkiye so this is not some ‚Äúwestern tourist‚Äù issue. T√ºrkiye really has an issue on its hands and it is very lucky it has such beautiful and significant historical and religious sites to encourage people to come. It seemed every time we left our hotel we were barraged with scammers viewing two Dutch blonde women as being rich. One of us is a school teacher and the other works in international development so we are not flush with cash. From start to finish, I felt extremely sad and guilty for feeling so upset and angry since this was my grandmother‚Äôs favourite place. I pride myself in being culturally respectful and sensitive, but even trying to take a step back and looking at it all from their perspective didn‚Äôt help. I would never dream of scamming anyone out of money while also pretending to be kind. Another box of worms: these guys scam, never face any consequences, but me, the gay person, has to pretend not to be while I‚Äôm in the country to be respectful of the homophobic culture and protect myself from being the victim of discrimination and crime. Makes total sense. 

For a country that wants so badly to be part of the European community, shame on it for supporting and tolerating this culture of scam. I‚Äôve travelled plenty throughout countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, etc. also wanting to be in the European Union and never once felt like every move was vulnerable to being scammed. 

I have many Turkish friends in the Netherlands and now fully understand why they wouldn‚Äôt want to live in T√ºrkiye. I understand this population of scammers represents a small portion of Turkish people and most people are good, but the country needs to stop allowing this sort of culture. Tons of police officers stand around doing nothing. There‚Äôs almost no way to report this sort of thing to be taken seriously. These men are allowed to yell from their shops and overcharge ‚Äúidiot‚Äù foreigners. 

I really supported the country before this, but now I will never come back to this country that my grandmother loved so dearly. I really am heartbroken.

Several years on, of course we all know the drawbacks now - both for visitors and for cities themselves. 

What increasingly shocks are the prices: often more expensive than hotels, plus you have to clean and tidy up after yourself at the end of your visit. 

Are you a formerly loyal Airbnb-user who‚Äôs recently gone back to preferring hotels, or is your preference for Airbnb here to stay? And if so, why?",2557,2023-05-08 07:06:53,sokorsognarf,0.95

1dxnie7,Travelling with a picky eater is the WORST ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dxnie7/travelling_with_a_picky_eater_is_the_worst/,14408,"Currently in Seoul, Korea with my aunt and my cousin. it was meant to be a solo trip but my aunt suggested that we travel together for 2 days since we are in Seoul together on these days. I've been here before but not them so she thought it'd Also be nice for me to guide them around for a bit.
 My cousin is the pickiest eater I have ever had the displeasure of travelling with. Such a royal pain in the butt. For her, even jokbal (pork trotters) is too ""exotic and weird"". We passed by a dakgalbi restaurant and she also refused because she's worried it'll be spicy (it's literally not...). We had a delicious kbbq dinner but she only ate plain meat and rice because she refused to eat any of the free side dishes. She sulked the whole dinner and we had to go to Subway after that. What about Korean fried chicken? Who doesn't like that?? HER.
The most irritating and audacious thing happened today. We went to a Korean Chinese restaurant and I ordered my favourite jajangmyeon, my aunt ordered jjampong and cousin ordered... dumplings. Yay. Something she's willing to eat. When my jajangmyeon came, she looked at it with disgust and let out a silent ""Eww"". And at some point even said something along the lines of ""that looks disgusting"" ""you really like that?"" ...I was really annoyed and pissed at that point but I didn't want to get angry on vacation so I just said ""Yeah it actually tastes better than it looks, want some?"" She shook her head and didn't say anything else. I just found her comments so stupid and uncalled
for because I spent some time on the map app searching for restaurants that has food her stupid palate can handle. 
Anyways we're fortunately parting ways tomorrow as I am moving to Suwon and then Busan so I can't wait to enjoy the rest of my trip eating all my favourite Korean food and she can eat all the sandwiches she want. I don't care if I sound childish or petty because I just needed to let this out because I've been so sick of her.

Korea is amazing though I highly recommend. ",934,2024-07-07 13:39:13,[deleted],0.88

13hmnlx,What I like and dislike about the USA.... as a tourist.,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13hmnlx/what_i_like_and_dislike_about_the_usa_as_a_tourist/,10918,"I have been touring the United States for several weeks now, visiting multiple states. I am from Europe. The Netherlands specifically.

This is not my first time in the US but it is my most extensive. It strikes me how vastly different the USA is compared to my country or Europe in general.

I'd just like to give my thoughts here from a European perspective. Which things I think are better here and which are worse. I am also keeping this limited to a tourist perspective, so I'm going to stay away from things that are only relevant when I would actually live here, like healthcare, taxes and politics.

I am aware that the vast majority of Reddit users are American. I do not intend to offend in any way. Just putting my personal opinions here.

Thinks I like

* Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA.
* People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude.
* Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one.
* Traffic lights across the street. I can't for the life of my understand why we still have to lean over the steering wheel and get a sore neck looking straight upwards at the traffic lights in Europe.
* The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.

Things I don't like

* Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware - you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises.
* The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe.
* Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels.
* Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?

So here are some of my thoughts. Feel free to add your own, or tell me where you agree or disagree. I'd love to read the same perspective from Americans who have visited Europe.",792,2023-05-14 15:36:59,MickJof,0.88

zi9u6x,Is it just me or has AirB‚ÄônB lost its charm?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zi9u6x/is_it_just_me_or_has_airbnb_lost_its_charm/,10445,"I feel like I‚Äôm cheating on a lover making this post. 

I used to LOVE AirB‚ÄônB. In fact, I haven‚Äôt stayed in hotels since 2016, always choosing AirB‚Äôn‚ÄôBs instead. I always found them simply better quality ‚Äî more space and utilities for less money. However, now‚Ä¶sadly I think some precious part of the AirB‚ÄônB magic is gone. It‚Äôs like it sold its soul. 

The last place I stayed in (November, 2022) had a pretty high cleaning fee AND I was left with a list of chores to do before I left. Actually, I‚Äôm neat and tidy so I clean up anyway but what got me most was the little laminated signs hung up everywhere. They all said ‚ÄúIf you use it, YOU CLEAN IT‚Äù. The last part was in all caps, bolded and underlined. It was like being stuck in a passive aggressive employee break room. Yucky.

And the worst thing is, I felt compelled to keep this feedback private for fear of retaliation from the host. 

AirB‚ÄônB have either failed to see this trend coming, or they think its negligible from a business point of view. I guess the gradual swing away from AirB‚ÄônB isn‚Äôt hurting their balance sheet enough‚Ä¶yet. 

It reminds me a little of the way eBay went. Once upon a time eBay had charm and was all about peer-to-peer commerce. Then all the mass-produced items flooded the site and it‚Äôs just a poor substitute for Amazon.

Edit to add: a helpful commenter shared this: https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-is-introducing-total-price-display-and-updating-guest-checkout/
Seems AirB‚ÄônB is at least trying to tackle some of the issues.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1eqk4es/lost_in_the_amazon_jungle_in_peru_thanks_to_an/,10121,"Booked a three day jungle trip from Iquitos, Peru. Within the first few hours, thanks to the extremely negligent (bordering on the reckless) decisions of the company and guide (edit: see company name below), we were completely lost deep in the Amazon jungle with no food, water or any safety supplies. Guide had collapsed from exhaustion and lay down to die, refusing to get up. Rescue was nothing short of a miracle. Full story is below - Any thoughts on how to make the company take some sort of responsibility are appreciated.

‚Äî‚Äî

My brother (21M) and I (27F) have always wanted to do a trip into the jungle, so planned an entire itinerary in Peru around doing so. We looked at a few different online tours, and booked a two-night tour leaving from Iquitos and going into the Amazon. The tour was one of the less luxurious options but had very good reviews so we felt it was a safe choice. We spent the days leading up to it in Lima procuring and stocking our day packs with safety supplies (correct clothing and gear, strong insect repellent, flashlights, medicines) and researching how to be safe. We were worried about lethal snake or spider bites, jaguars, caimans, mosquito-borne diseases etc, but the golden rule from all of the advice online was to always trust and follow your guide and you‚Äôll be safe, as they know the jungle and will always cut a safe path for you and point out dangers. Thousands of people do Amazon tours every year and have a great time. We were really excited.

On the day the trip was starting, we met at the office in Iquitos and then took a boat for about an hour and a half down the Amazon river. The small group doing our tour included our guide (Peruvian \~35M but seemed to speak good English), a young girl who seemed to serve no purpose except to accompany him, and a mother and daughter (\~55F and 30F), the latter of which spoke fluent English and Spanish.

The boat made a couple of five minute stops along the way, firstly to get some gas and then to let some other guests off. It stopped a third time at about 11am and our guide motioned for us to get off. We thought we must be starting the tour so picked up our bags, but he told us to leave our bags on the boat. We assumed this was just another five minute stop. We asked if we needed our gumboots, and he said no.

We follow him off the boat. When we get up the river bank, he looks at our empty hands and asks ‚Äúdo you not have any water?‚Äù We were extremely confused as he had told us to leave our things on the boat and hadn‚Äôt explained what we were doing. He says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, we are just doing a short 20-minute walk down the the track to a local village so you'll be fine.‚Äù The guide didn't have any water either. My brother and I are a bit concerned, but by the time we turn around the boat has already left with our stuff (including our water, carefully chosen repellent etc), so we trust that we only have a short period of walking and we follow the guide down the track into the jungle.

The first 20 minutes are lovely and the guide is exemplary of what we had read online, pointing out interesting insects and telling us which ones to avoid, and showing us the safe places to step. At some point though, he leads us off the track and into the deep jungle. I‚Äôm completely unconcerned and assuming this is all part of the plan. He tells us later that this is because he came across a large fallen tree over the track and we had to go around it.

Things start to go a bit awry from here. We walk through the deep jungle for an hour or so, and our guide is becoming less responsible. He‚Äôs charging ahead and leaving us to cut our own path (he doesn‚Äôt have a machete or delicate instructions of where to step like the guides we read about online). We have to clamber over trunks, under vines, avoid vicious ants, and get stuck in mud. Luckily we didn‚Äôt encounter anything more deadly; god knows it was definitely lurking. The mother who was with us fell over a few times and the guide didn't seem to care.

Eventually we make it to a small clearing and are starting to get a bit fed up, given we are yet to reach the village and are getting hungry, thirsty, sweaty, muddy and bitten. But, we are relieved to be out of the thick forest. The clearing has a basic bamboo shelter, and a little stream with two small aluminium boats. Is this the village? Our guide tells us to wait here and disappears for another half an hour without communicating anything to us, which is extremely irritating. He eventually returns and explains that we have to go back as ‚Äúthe boat that was meant to pick us up isn‚Äôt there‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt make any sense as we thought we were heading to a village. He says it will be 20 minutes maximum to get back to the river and, to our relief, starts leading us along a small dirt track. At this point (probably around 2pm) we just want to get back ASAP - we‚Äôre hungry and thirsty. To our dismay, he shortly leads us off the track again back into the jungle, pointing at the sun and saying that he can tell which direction the river is in. Although annoyed that we have to wade through mud again, I still at this point have no suspicion that we are lost, and trust that he knows exactly where he‚Äôs taking us. My brother isn‚Äôt so sure, and says to us ‚Äúif he‚Äôs using the sun as navigation I‚Äôm not that confident about this‚Äù. The rest of us laugh and follow our guide as all of the online advice told us to do. Stick with the guide, you‚Äôll be fine.

We stumble our way through the deep jungle without any assistance. By now, the guide is charging so far ahead that we can barely see him and have to keep yelling out to him. We are being bitten by red ants which is very painful, falling over and wading through mud, where we could hear running water bubbling underneath us. At one point, I fell thigh-deep into a muddy swamp and screamed, half expecting a caiman to bite my legs off (our gumboots would have come in handy if we hadn't been told leave them behind). The guide did not seem to care. At this point we scream to him to slow the fuck down and wait for us because this is extremely dangerous. He eventually does and stops to talk to us, saying that we should wait here (in the middle of nowhere) and his colleague will bring us food and water. Again, we are confused. He then leaves again into the jungle before we can stop him. We are in disbelief.  We look around and there is dense forest/swamp in all directions and we are being constantly bitten by mosquitos. We don't want to wait here for long, especially without water and repellent.

He returns a few minutes later looking extremely exhausted, having taken off his shirt, and collapses onto the forest floor. Between desperate gasps for breath, he finally drops the act and admits he has no idea where we are. We are completely lost.

It soon becomes clear that we have been lost for hours. We figure the guide was charging ahead to try and find a familiar path and completely exhausted himself doing so. He has collapsed shirtless on a muddy log, with loads of insects biting him. He is too exhausted to care. He is delirious and completely incoherent, seemingly forgetting how to speak English except to ask for water (which we didn‚Äôt have) - luckily the daughter in our group could translate for us, because he managed to get a bit of phone reception and called his boss. We learned from her that he could not explain to his boss where on earth we were. He was even trying to describe the clearing with the two boats (which the boss did not recognise), showing that we were already lost all the way back then, and he had tried to hide it from us all that time. He had nothing with him to prepare for this situation: no flare, no water, no machete, no GPS, not even a compass.

We spend the next hour or so trying to think logically about how to survive. We got the guide‚Äôs phone password and contacts as it seemed that we were going to lose him at any minute. Although I didn‚Äôt have reception, my google map had partially loaded so that we could perhaps see the direction of the river and hack through the jungle to make our way to it and hopefully flag someone down. I was nervous about doing this because (1) it meant leaving the guide (who kept insisting he couldn't stand), leaving us without his knowledge of the jungle but also leaving him to die; (2) I really doubted whether the map was correct and (3) it would mean hours navigating the thick jungle by ourselves, risking encountering deadly animals, dangerous tribes, anything. And, we probably only had an hour of sunlight left...

We were all extremely thirsty and were trying not to panic, but things were not looking good. It was extremely hot and muddy, mosquitoes were flying everywhere, and we were on constant alert for snakes, spiders, jaguars etc. Everyone remained extremely calm and thought logically which was a blessing (the mother and I shared a hug; I think she suspected I was about to get upset), and we were so lucky to have the other two in our group, but it was looking like we were going to have to try and survive the night (or longer) in the Amazon jungle without water, without a guide, and without any of our supplies.

The daughter then manages to get a bit of reception on her phone and can speak directly to the boss herself, although we still have no way of describing our whereabouts. We send him a screenshot of my half-loaded map image. She contacts her boyfriend and tells him that she will likely die in the jungle and that she loves him, but can he please contact the authorities asap. We ask our guide what the emergency number in Peru is and he brazenly refuses to tell us (I guess because he was worried about getting in trouble). So does his pointless girlfriend.

We discuss our options, including the risk of leaving the guide behind, as he is still refusing to move or offer any advice despite our pleas. We eventually decide that, because the sun is going down and because of the risks associated with trying to get to the river, we are safer trying to go back the way we came and at least find the dirt track, which is safer from nature than the deep jungle and which also has a better chance of someone coming along the track and finding us. My brother is confident that he can remember the way back (I‚Äôm not). The guide, realising that we are about to leave him here on his own, gets a new lease of life and we are able to heave him to his feet. He stumbles ahead behind my brother, and I‚Äôm at the back with the other three girls. We are all trying not to break down.

Eventually, dozens of ant stings later, we hear a faint motor engine in the distance. We start screaming for help at the top of our lungs. To our dismay, it sounds like it has gone past without hearing us, but then we hear the noise stop. We keep screaming for our lives until, a few minutes later, we hear voices coming towards us through the jungle. We start crying with relief. Six villagers reach us, drag us back through the jungle, and load us onto a tray on the back of a motorbike, with water and biscuits. We learn that they are from one of the jungle villages who were contacted to go out looking for us, which is why they were on the track.

I think by now it‚Äôs about 4pm. The guide has  attempts to explain what happened, stating that he has over a decade of experience in the jungle and this has never happened before. We tell him that we just want to go home. He starts off saying it‚Äôs not possible to get back to Iquitos tonight and that we will need to stay at the jungle lodge with him, but we won‚Äôt take no for an answer. We don‚Äôt trust him one bit with our safety. He eventually agrees to arrange for a boat to take us back.

We ride on the back of the motorbike for about half an hour, over bumpy terrain and occasionally getting stuck in the mud (it seems like this track hasn't been used in a long time). We are still being bitten by ants - my brother has hundreds stuck in his trousers. But we are all so thankful to be alive.

On our journey back, we learn that my map image was completely wrong and that it seemed to be a snapshot of my last downloaded location many hours ago. We also learn that the villagers on the bike didn‚Äôt hear our screams over the motor - one of them happened to fall off at the exact right time, so they stopped the bike to let him back on and that‚Äôs when they heard us.

From speaking to locals and looking online, it seems like this is the first time a guided tour from Iquitos has got lost in the Amazon.

We eventually got back to the office expecting apologies and compensation. Obviously, the money is not important at all when compared to our survival. But, to our huge surprise, the boss said we couldn‚Äôt get our money back because ‚Äúit‚Äôs already been spent on the lodge‚Äù. We argued and argued and he eventually agreed to give us some in cash back now and another portion later to our bank account, but we won‚Äôt see that in our account for a couple of weeks and even then it would only be a bit over half what we paid. He basically called our bluff on bringing them to justice. He only gave the other two about half of theirs back as well. We ended up giving up as he was being pretty menacing and we felt unsafe, and just wanted to get the next flight out of there.

Of course we plan to write a bad review for the company but we want to see the money first, although might cut our losses on that. We just feel like it‚Äôs perverse that we were left to die in the jungle in extremely dangerous circumstances and it was completely the fault of the company that we put our trust in. They were severely negligent sending us with an incompetent guide without any supplies for the worst case scenario (which is what eventuated). It was an absolute death trap. We are still very shaken by the whole experience (this happened 4 days ago). And are also sad to have not had the adventure we dreamed about for ages.

Although we were still a few hours or days off dying of thirst, the scary part was the prospect of having to survive the night, or longer, in the jungle alongside all the horrors of the Amazon and still being no closer to being found.

One of our group videoed the entire thing. We are hoping to get the footage from her and can post the link once we do.

Any thoughts on what we can do are welcome. Thanks for reading!

EDIT:

Name of tour company: Canopy Tours Iquitos

Itinerary and trip we booked was called Iquitos: Amazon Expedition 3 days, can find the itinerary on Get Your Guide, seems to not let me post with the link but should come up with a google and had good reviews on there.

EDIT 2: we booked directly through the company‚Äôs website after finding itinerary and reviews on GYG, their website can be found online too",975,2024-08-12 12:41:07,Happy_Bookkeeper7933,0.95

1f8wy6p,9 days in Norway‚Äôs stunning Lofoten Islands,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f8wy6p,8594,"The Lofoten islands are absolutely breathtaking. These are my favorite images from the trip.

Pic 14: Tjeldbergtind view of Svolv√¶r

Pic 15: Henningsv√¶r

Pic 16: Verdenssvaet hike, near Narvik

We spent nine days in the area. Most of the stunning scenic areas start around Svolv√¶r and progressively become more impressive as you go west towards the village of √Ö at the far southwestern end of the archipelago, with about 2.5 hours driving distance between them.

Some quick suggestions: 

1. Getting there: Most will first fly into Oslo and then take a flight up to one of many regional airports such as Evenes (EVE, for rental car), Troms√∏ (TOS, for rental car), Bod√∏ (BOO, for ferry), or even directly to Svolvaer (SVJ) or Leknes (LKN) on smaller airplanes with more limited / seasonal schedules.

2. Good bases to stay in would be Reine / Hamn√∏y area, Leknes / Ballstad area, and Henningsv√¶r/Kabelv√•g area. These areas are central to many scenic spots and highlights. If you have the time, I would allocate 2-3 nights to each area so you can minimize driving time and explore each area in depth. 

3. Weather can be quite variable. We were there in late August and had many days of rain / cloud, but we still got to do hikes and outdoor activities every day as the rain would stop and the sun came out. Be prepared with good hiking shoes, ponchos/umbrellas and a flexible, open attitude!

4. Costs: The most expensive prices are for rental cars at $125-150 per day (likely cheaper outside of peak summer season). Gas was NOK 20-25/liter (approx. US$7.50-9.00 per gallon). Restaurant entrees are US$35-45 at upscale places and $20-30 at moderate places (no additional tax / tip beyond menu prices). There are decent groceries in larger towns such as Leknes and Svolvaer where food prices are moderate and many rorbu hotels have kitchens or kitchenette. Hotel costs are in line with popular international tourist destinations at $250-500+ per night.

5. Things to do: 

Stunning scenery everywhere you look. Nature lover and photographers‚Äô dream. The two lane highway E10 that links the islands must be one of the most scenic drives in the world.

Outdoor activities‚Äî Hiking, with very high payoff vs effort ratio. Kayaking, fjord cruises, boating, and surfing / beach in good summer weather. 

Culture and history, where you can learn about Lofoten fishermen way of life, colorful rorbu cabins, stockfish production and salmon farming, and even the Vikings (the museum is on the site of the largest Viking longhouse ever found)

Dear god, what a mistake. If this post can deter anybody from going and spending money in this country, it served its purpose. I‚Äôve never been anywhere where the general population was so misogynistic and disrespectful to women. You are completely and blatantly lied to and ripped off by everyone everywhere - regardless of how ‚Äúsavvy‚Äù of a traveler you think you are. When you are not dealing with that you are battling constant food poisoning despite ""playing it safe"" and eating in the higher end hotels (Sofitel, Marriott, etc). The street food in Southeast Asia is safer. The joke is truly on the tourists who choose to come here. Want to go to the Pyramids? Prepare to get harassed and haggled into getting on a dying horse that will be beaten and whipped to keep moving. Want to go inside the Pyramids? Prepare to be cornered and shaken down for everything in your wallet. The same goes for Karnak and The Valley of the Kings in Luxor. Make sure you don‚Äôt go into any corners or tight spots because the people ‚Äúworking‚Äù there will block you and make you pay them. Sharm El Sheikh? If you are a diver than the red sea is beautiful, everything else including the hotel is an absolute Russian wasteland (my wife is Russian I can say this). Think it‚Äôs cheap? Speak English and your prices are pinged to the dollar. Even the doctor at the Sofitel in Cairo will charge you $300 USD for a covid test (costs around $80 USD everywhere else). I consider myself a savvy traveler and I have been all over the middle east, some places better than others. This is the worst place I have ever been to and I highly recommend you pick another destination. A real tragedy for 50% of Egyptians who are nice people, because the other 50% have ruined the country. I am a male in my 30's.",1382,2021-10-13 17:10:01,[deleted],0.94

1f48sg1,12 days in Namibia ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f48sg1,7999,"I spent a few months traveling in Africa with my boyfriend, and Namibia was the third country we visited. We were there from April 26th - May 7th. I love the desert so Namibia was incredible! The weather was hot but dry, low to high 90's usually. We did most activities early in the morning or late afternoon, too hot between 1-4pm to really do anything. We opted to rent our own car and self-drive, it was easy to do and definitely one of the easier African countries to take this approach. It gave us a lot of freedom to spend our time how we wanted (vs with tours), and especially during safari we could pick and could spend as much time as we wanted with our favorite animals (lions are kinda boring, give me more wildebeest! The drama). We never felt unsafe at any point on the trip. 

We spent 2 camping nights in Sossuvlei National Park, 2 nights in Swakupmund, 2 nights in Damaraland, and 3 nights doing self-drive safari in Etosha National Park. Each end was capped with a night in Windhoek. It was jam packed and all of it was great for different reasons! Didn't have a fancy camera with so a lot of the safari pics aren't as fancy as other peoples. 

Highlights included: 
- Enjoying desert sunsets at our campground in Sossuvlei. 
- Deadvlei was what inspired the trip, and it was as awesome as I had hoped. Crowds were not a problem for us. 
- Spent a half day doing looking for Welwitschia plants out by Swakupmund, extremely rare and can be up to 1500 years old. They're much bigger than I was expecting! 
- Desert elephant tracking in Damaraland. Saw a group of 14 elephants plus 3 bulls.
- Seeing a cheetah hunt in Etosha after being in the park for 5 min (didn't get the catch) 
- Watching rhino drama at the watering holes in Etosha every night. They're so grumpy and dramatic, its like Real Housewives of Namibia. At one point we could count 15, Etosha is def the place to go to see them. We did safari in five other countries and only saw one rhino (Kruger). ",192,2024-08-29 12:50:25,chokemypinky,0.99

I had the most incredible time and fortunately nothing I was worried about came to fruition. I am aware I am possibly just lucky but I wasn‚Äôt groped, didn‚Äôt get ill, never felt as though I was in danger, wasn‚Äôt mugged or assaulted. 

I travelled with my older sister (33), two friends in their 70s and we had a guide for 80% of the trip who was amazing. I‚Äôve never travelled with a guide before, but I felt very safe with him and his knowledge was amazing, we all learned so much. 

We went to Delhi, Agra, Ranthambore, Jaipur and Varanasi. I loved all of them, couldn‚Äôt possibly choose my favourite! The people we met were incredibly kind and the service in hotels/restaurants was another level. 

Of course the food was also amazing! We ate in some street food places but tried to stick to those with actual kitchens behind them. Avoided tap water and only had ice if it was a bougie restaurant (I always double checked it was filtered water regardless).

ue11oe,Went to Egypt and it was just as terrible yet gorgeous as everyone described,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ue11oe/went_to_egypt_and_it_was_just_as_terrible_yet/,6813,"Went to Cairo and Luxor for 4 days total and quite honestly it was enough for me. From the moment we landed to the moment we left-

Endless street harassment! For what it‚Äôs worth- we‚Äôre seasoned travelers who have been to over 20 countries, and coming from an even poorer country myself it was appalling the level of antagonizing we got while there!

To start of with the good- I have never seen anything as incredible as the pyramids, or the temples in Luxor. Like I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around how something that beautiful and precise count have been made. Especially Hatshepsut temple. Definitely worthy of all the bad we endured. But holy hell, my partner and I were saying how, at the end of 4 days, we would never want to go back.

The usual camel hawkers and the knee selling junky items for 10x the price didn‚Äôt bother us. We got a tour guide which was fine but he went so fast. So we came back the next day on our own to try and slow down and enjoy. Well we were walking around and an official looking guy in a suit blew his whistle and was like ‚Äúticket‚Äù? To which already paid. He went on the whole spiel about how he‚Äôs a friend, waved us through , and then tried to push us through the‚Äùcorrect ‚Äú pathway. We followed and of course immediately cornered us and asked for money. Gave him $5 usd and he was like ‚Äúgive me more. I see another $5‚Äù to which we refused. To anyone who said we should have been smarter- there‚Äôs a ton of police around the pyramids, if someone blows a whistle at you, you stop and comply; you don‚Äôt expect it to be some scumbag.


The most egregious one was in the airport, we had to pass a tunnel to get to our terminal. It was really early so it as just my partner running around. An official airport security man asked for his passport (normal) where he was going , and at the end REFUSED TO GIVE THE PASSPORT BACK AND JUST HELD OUT HIS HAND EXPECTING MONEY. Said nothing, because he knew my partner was alone and would not make a fuss.gave him $1 usd bc he was holding the passport hostage and again he had the audacity to say, that‚Äôs it?


We had people follow us for several hundred feet to our car asking us to buy shit. That‚Äôs annoying as hell and out of sheer spite I refused to buy anything.  The whole dropping you off at some crappy papyrus/essence/stone store at the end of the tour put a really bad taste in my mouth although I know we could say no. EVERYONE was all ‚Äúmy friend my friend‚Äù but no one treated us with genuine kindness when we needed help.

We ran out of cash but only had a credit card-  no one at the bank would help. We desperately asked a restaurant- well they did, but at a 15% fee AND MORE TIP FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE on top of that. Knowing damn well the actual cash advance fee is 5% at most and they pocketed the rest.

Then they have their women and children monopolizing most toilets, handing you paper towels you didn‚Äôt ask for in one hand, hand out reached for tip in another. For effing paper towels that I can just get myself.


Unfortunately my pity for them is mixed with resentment and anger. Poverty is no reason to be dishonorable, that is an absolute insult to poor people everywhere.

But at the end I was getting terrified that we couldn‚Äôt leave, someone would extort us, and we‚Äôd be stuck in this country. At one point, we even drafted an email to the us embassy for help bc we were stranded without money (had lots of credit cards though)

y1h4au,After leaving Europe I'm finding it hard to enjoy the US,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/y1h4au/after_leaving_europe_im_finding_it_hard_to_enjoy/,6629,"I spent most of the summer railing around Europe and spent time in many cities I've never been. I feel I really got into the lifestyle there. Sitting outside to eat on summer nights. Walking and taking transit everywhere. Seeing people outside everywhere partaking in the city. Enjoying the historic charm that is in abundance, feeling safe everywhere at all hours(maybe with the exception of Marseilles and parts of London), etc. 

I feel like the US in comparison is just...underwhelming. I currently live in Nashville and most of my life have lived in Los Angeles. I want to move to a new city but really don't like any city in the US enough to be excited about going there. And it seems the only places in America that might give you a slice of that European lifestyle are prohibitively expensive, like San Francisco or NYC.

I feel like most Americans cities are sprawling, bland, built around cars, terrible transit, unsafe. A few years ago I was walking through downtown Atlanta on a weekend in the afternoon and was stunned that there were no people walking other than me. It was like the city had been abandoned. I could not imagine the center of a European city being completely empty of pedestrians. There is more vibrancy in a European city of 200,000 than in an American city of 2 million. 

After the architectural splendor of Prague and Edinburgh. the Mediterranean charm of old town Nice, eating in the medieval alleyways of Croatia, I come back to America and feel kind of depressed at the landscape of strip malls, drive-thru Starbucks, urban blight, sprawling suburbs with cookie cutter houses and no sidewalks or pedestrians in sight. Maybe one little historic ""old town"" street downtown that you have to drive into and that's full of souvenir shops and chain restaurants. 

I guess I'm just ranting and experiencing post-vacation blues, but I'm missing the European lifestyle so much it hurts and I'm having difficulty adjusting to America. I liked just about every European city I visited. There are very few American cities I'd bother visiting unless I had a specific reason to go there. 

On the plus side, the variety of natural scenery in the US, particularly the western US rivals anything in Europe and maybe surpasses it. And increasingly I'd rather rent a cabin in some place like the Smoky Mountains or Sierras in California than visit the cities.",1876,2022-10-11 13:55:11,ReflexPoint,0.85

Ljubljana is a cool city but the highlights for us were definitely the mountains ! We rented a car and stayed in a small town outside Bled and used it as a base to visit Bled and surrounding nature. View from the town is in image 8. We were able to explore quite a bit such as Lake Bled, Lake Bohinj, and the Soca Valley. If you‚Äôre wondering what the blue lake is in image 3 that‚Äôs Lago di Fusine about 6 km over on the Italian side of the border and the backdrop is genuinely the most beautiful panorama I‚Äôve ever seen. I should really emphasize none of these pics are filtered in any way and the water is genuinely that blue ! We visited in mid May and the weather was genuinely pleasant apart from some spotty rain. From what I‚Äôve read this is a good time to go since places like Lake Bled and Bohinj get packed during the summer. Let me know if you have any questions.

We fly out of Italy and have a layover in Frankfurt before heading back to the states. We are wondering what to expect at the airport. Will Italy be the determining authority on this since it‚Äôs where we initially fly out of or will we be questioned in Germany as well? What is the likelihood of a fine, ban, or worse punishment. 

Any advice or info would be great, thanks y‚Äôall

EDIT: for everyone wondering if we intentionally did this, no. We traveled to Morocco for two days thinking that would reset our 90 days which we obviously now know it does not. Yes we were stupid and should‚Äôve looked more into it before assuming.

UPDATE: we changed our flight to go directly from Italy to the US. It departs tomorrow 9/16 in the morning. I will post another update after going through security.

UPDATE 2: just made it through security. No fine, no deportation, no ban, no gulag. No one even said a word to us. They didn‚Äôt scan our passport just stamped it. Cheers y‚Äôall",1862,2023-09-13 11:23:42,LouieTheThird,0.88

She exited the subway car while her little sister yelled ""No, wrong stop!"" and everyone in the train looked. It took a second but my wife realized what was happening and tried to get off too but she was slowed by the packed crowd (our kids had gone to sit down, so we were separated a bit.) She shouted ""Stay at that station!"" A young guy by the door heard the commotion and jumped out the doors right before they closed.

Early in the trip, we had told my daughter if we got separated to wait at the next station and we would come get her. So, my wife got out at the next stop with my younger daughter and I rode the subway going the other direction back a station. 

Back one station, I saw the young guy standing with my daughter. After checking if she was OK, I bowed deeply to the young guy and said ""Arigato Gozaimasu"". But he was barely paying any attention to me: Someone else had gotten off the subway with me, the young guy's friend I presume, and they were pointing at each other and laughing. The young guy must have texted his friend to tell him to come back a station as he had unexpectedly gotten off the train to help my daughter.

My daughter told me she had cried a bit but then the young guy used Google translate to have her try to call me but she  forgot to dial the country code so the call failed. He then tried to take her to the station master but the station was unmanned. Then they just came back to the platform to wait for me.

The four of us (young guy, his friend, my daughter and me) hopped back onto the train going in the original direction again. I tried talking to the guy but he didn't speak English and we couldn't pull out our phones for Google Translate as it was too crowded and we were both holding stuff.

Thank you young guy for providing company and comfort to my daughter when she got lost! I feel bad I was unable to express my gratitude appropriately due to language barrier. He was very nonchalant and humble about the whole thing but it really meant the world to me and her. Travelling in foreign places, when your are most confused and lost, you meet the nicest people.

The geography is incredibly diverse‚Äîendless steppes, dramatic mountains, serene lakes, and even deserts.

Places visited:

 Altyn Emel National Park, Lake Issyk, Black Canyon, Lake Kaindy, Lake Kolsai, Charyn Canyon, Shymbulak (Hiked to Bognadovich Glacier in the Tien Shan mountain ranges), Ayusai, Alma Arasan, and did a city tour (Kok Tobe, Cathedral, Green Bazaar etc.).

We focused on hiking over city exploration. In Charyn Grand Canyon, most tourists stick to the 1.5 km top view walk, but we opted for a longer 6 km round trip through the Valley of Castles for a closer look at the canyon. It was hot, so we made sure to carry plenty of fluids, and the walk was definitely worth it. There‚Äôs a river at the end where you can rest under the trees.

At Shymbulak, we took the cable car to the second level, hiked up to the Bogdanovich Glacier, and made it back just in time for the last cable car at 5:30 pm. Out of many tourists, only about 12 others did the hike. The glacier was stunning, and we were thrilled to have seen it.

1fhylov,12 days in Slovenia ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fhylov,5560,"‚Ä¢ Ljubljana (6,13,19). A very pretty, walkable city. There's not that many things to do, but it has a very relaxed atmosphere, and is a great place to do day trips from since the country is so small. I did a day trip to the Logar Valley (8) which was stunning, unfortunately I didn't get to cycle the Solƒçava panoramic road which looks amazing.

‚Ä¢ Lake Bled (1,7,9,17). Best thing to do is to get up early and enjoy the lake in the morning when there aren't as many people. Later in the day it gets so crowded with people and cars! My favourite thing I did is hike up to the Ojstrica viewpoint for sunrise, its incredible watching the sunrise over the mountains. The view from Mala Osojnica further up is even better!

‚Ä¢ Periƒçnik Waterfall (4). This was one of my highlights, the waterfall was so beautiful and a lot bigger than I was expecting! It was really impressive to walk behind it, and I also went down to the base of it and got drenched, but it was an amazing experience!

‚Ä¢ Tolmin &amp; Soƒça Valley (2,12,14,15,18). The water is incredibly clear and the area is great for ziplining, rafting, paragliding, canyoning etc. Kozjak Waterfall and the Soƒça Gorges are beautiful! I didn't have time to do the Vrsic Pass, but I'd say its a must.

‚Ä¢ Postojna and Skocjan Caves (10). Unfortunately Skocjan Caves didn't allow photos, but it was genuinely one of the most surreal places I've been! The scale of the underground chamber is incredible, I thought I was in the Mines of Moria in Lord of the Rings! You can see the old path the explorers took hanging from the side of the canyon, I can't imagine how they must have felt!  If you have time, Postojna Cave is great also. It doesn't compare to Skocjan, but the undergound train is really cool, and the rock formations are crazy. It's a lot more touristy though.

‚Ä¢ Piran (3,5,11,16,20). Delicious seafood and beautiful venetian architecture and alleways. Watching the sunset from the town walls was a great way to end the holiday!",163,2024-09-16 02:14:02,not_a_windowcleaner,0.99

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm absolutely devastated and just need to share what happened. My friend and I were super excited about our trip to Palermo, Italy‚Äîone of our much-anticipated stops. We got to our Airbnb, and our host was super nice, showed us around, and everything seemed perfect.

But when the airbnb hosts asked for our passport I went to car to grab it and I saw our fully filled back compartment completly empty. We‚Äôre now looking at a 9-hour drive to Rome to get to the embassy and try to sort this mess out.

One of our theories is that someone was following us around for about 10 minutes before we got to the Airbnb. They must have seen how full our back compartment was. The moment we parked, they smashed the window to pieces and grabbed our bag. The doors were locked, but that didn‚Äôt stop them.

I have no idea what to do. The stuff in that bag‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just so hard to even imagine it‚Äôs all gone. I‚Äôm at a complete loss for words right now.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? What did you do? Any advice on how to handle this would be so appreciated. We‚Äôre just trying to figure out our next steps.

We‚Äôve just finished up an awesome 2 month trip around Europe, ending the last week in Amsterdam. We of course got amongst the coffee shops in amsterdam and had a few joints here and there and I forgot that I stored one in my backpack. When I ‚Äòdouble checked‚Äô my back pack before heading to the airport, i didn‚Äôt find the joint as I didn‚Äôt even realise I had one in there, as I thought I must have smoked it. Low and behold, we go through security at Dubai, which we were planning on a hop on hop off tour as we had a 15 hour layover, and the security guard pulls out none other than the joint i had forgotten was in there. No good. Spent most of the day getting finger printed, questioned and searched to the point I‚Äôm now being deported and never allowed back in the UAE. If this was 2 years ago I would be locked up for 4 years minimum, so I consider myself lucky. This goes for anyone buying weed or any other substance that may be legal where you buy it, do NOT store them in a difficult-to-find pocket in your backpack and forget about it. And before I get flamed saying this was just stupid, I already know, I‚Äôve heard it all day.      EDIT: I would just like to clarify for the people accusing me of ignorance about taking weed to a country that it‚Äôs not allowed. I didn‚Äôt do it intentionally and I never would. I put this joint in my bag at the start of the week in amsterdam. I had even bought more joints throughout the week as I thought I didn‚Äôt have any left, because I forgot about the one in my bag. I may be stupid for forgetting it, but I‚Äôm not a complete asshole with a lack of respect on laws of other countries. It was an honest mistake, which I have paid for. I do not need people telling me ‚Äúnext time just don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù No shit. It wasn‚Äôt mean to happen in the first place.",858,2023-07-20 12:03:27,D4ddyF4tS4ck1,0.91

We were approaching the coastline of Greenland when the flight attendants came through the cabin closing the shutters. The FA gave me a thumbs-up to leave my shutter partially open. The scenery was stunning! After about 10 minutes, a fellow passenger approached me (ironically with an eye mask in his hand) and said that the light was bothering him. I replied that I wanted to look at the scenery for a bit longer. After another 10 minutes the FA apologetically asked me to close the shutter as a baby needed to sleep. The window shutters were down for most of the flight. 

There are of course planes that have dimmable shades, and these can be centrally controlled. I have been on a flight or two where the windows have been locked dark for most of the flight.  

I have loved watching beautiful sunsets, sunrises, starry skies, mountains, icebergs, etc. It makes me very sad that these experiences seem to be becoming a thing of the past.

So this is more of a rant than anything. We often see people here complain about families trying to demand single passengers to move their seat, and I've had that happen to me too as a solo traveler. But today, I experienced the opposite.

I traveled with my niece (just turned 2 last week) for the first time since I've gotten custody of her. I bought two flight tickets - one for me and one for her - and made sure we would sit together at time of booking. The traveling went well. I was super anxious so I scoured many subs and took tips and tricks to help with the flight. And she did amazing!

But despite all of that, what was supposed to be the start of a fun trip was soured by a middle aged couple who demanded I give them my niece's seat. Not ask, but demand. I pointed out that I paid for her ticket and this is her seat according to her boarding pass. Instead of taking that answer, they demanded I put the baby on my lap. They repeated that it wasn't fair she is taking that seat. Again, I told them this is her paid seat and showed them the boarding passes. I know I didn't need to but I was anxious with traveling and was just trying to end this drama. This couple was still adamant that I give them that seat. Knowing that they would get nowhere with me, they called on the flight attendant who didn't say anything to me. She asked another passenger to move to the seat next to us and put the couple together.

Yes, very anticlimactic but the whole situation threw me off and I'm already dreading the flight back home.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the comments. Venting about it on here definitely helped me clear my head and we ended up having a great first day! At the time, I was frustrated and also in disbelief that people can act this entitled. I have now reframed this incident as a learning opportunity to not engage and instead call a FA if another situation like this were to happen.

1g62gp6,Vietnam's visitor return rate is very low - It's moments like these that keep me coming back.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g62gp6,4463,"Despite the stats which say Vietnam's return visitor rate is as low as 5% (compared to Thailand's ~80%), it's the country I visit the most in Southeast Asia.

Yes, Tan Son airport is a scammer's paradise - that's why I always fly into Da Nang.

No, the people aren't as immediately warm and welcoming as in other neighbouring countries - but when you do make a connection, I find them to be deeply meaningful and long-lasting.

No, the country doesn't offer the familiar amenities that Thailand has to offer - I prefer this as it forces you to explore how locals actually live.

No, the country is not curated for tourism like its neighbours - this provides opportunities for more authentic connections and experiences rather than always feeling like you're a walking wallet.

No, the country doesn't have incredible beaches like Thailand - but it does have amazing variation in landscape and climate.

No, Vietnam doesn't have the same global veneration for its cuisine - but what it does have to offer is an incredibl diverse and healthy array of foods to sample.

And, for those on a budget, it's just about the most affordable country you could possibly visit.

I've been to every country in SEA, multiple times. They're all amazing in their own way and I plan on revisiting all of them throughout the course of my life (if l'd be so lucky).

But Vietnam, for some reason, is the one I always think of first and foremost as the country which offers the most opportunity and reward for travellers willing to dig deep and get out of their comfort zone.

That's why I think I keep going back. It takes no effort to feel comfortable and find a good time in Thailand - and you know what? There's nothing wrong with that. It's a pertect reason to visit.

In Vietnam, I find that you need to earn your memories, connections and experiences. And that's what makes them so much more valuable to me.",408,2024-10-17 16:52:19,Number8,0.92

Due to a problem with online check-in he had to go to the check-in desk and pay extra for checking in there. He did not get assigned a seat. When he told me this I thought he would surely get one at the gate.

Once boarding was finished he was told he was bumped off due to overbooking. Over the phone the staff at the gate told me they could give us ‚Ç¨250 compensation and sort accommodation until their next flight to Iceland‚Ä¶ which leaves in a week! His coach was given the option to volunteer her seat and accept the minimal compensation and the same deal - which would have meant her leaving the rest of the group (which included children younger than him).

They offered absolutely no help in getting him on another flight the same day‚Ä¶ and no understanding of how grave the situation was, to leave a 14 year old alone stranded in a foreign country. They just kept saying that they didn‚Äôt know how old he was!

Luckily there was a family bumped off too who offered to take care of him. I booked him on the only flight available home today (which cost a fortune)

He will be home soon but I am so lost for words‚Ä¶

EDIT: for those of you interested in how the trip was organized and things to say about the coach please find answers in comments. For all intents and purposes my could have been travelling alone. He was travelling on a solo ticket (like many kids do and he has done before to see his grandparents abroad) to an international sports camp which offered pick up and drop off to the airport. The coach from our local club chaperoning was faced with this situation at the gate. I just feel lucky she was there. She also had responsibility for the other kids in the group. 

When I spoke to the family who offered to take care of him I told the coach to go with the group not to leave them unaccompanied. 

Of course we should not have booked Wizz air. Which is why I am here warning others. ",449,2024-08-10 12:59:11,Silly-Turnip-8547,0.94

Iceland‚Äôs landscapes were breathtaking, and even while standing amidst them, they felt unreal. We managed to fit in 4-6 activities each day and covered almost everything on our list. Traveling around was incredibly easy, and I highly recommend hiking‚Äîit‚Äôs worth every step!

My top three experiences were hiking Glymur waterfall, exploring the Katla glacier and ice cave, and visiting Glj√∫frab√∫i and Seljalandsfoss. We were fortunate to have amazing weather for most of the trip. Aside from some rain in Reykjavik on the first night, the next eight days were perfect, with one day reaching 67¬∞F during our hike. The last day was windy and freezing, and we were so glad that wasn‚Äôt the weather for the whole trip!

1djl5c4,Nicaragua is not a place for tourists,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1djl5c4/nicaragua_is_not_a_place_for_tourists/,4110,"Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere so I‚Äôm not going to shame it or the people. I will say that it is not a country for tourists, nor is it tourist friendly. We were pulled over for ‚Äúspeeding‚Äù and the cop threatened to take our license if we didn‚Äôt give him $100. We settled for $15 and went on our way.  At the airport we were charged a $10 fee for being tourists which was cash only. Our Airbnb expected us to provide a $300 deposit after we already paid and arrived. We rented a vehicle through budget and after returning it, they wanted us to pay $100 for a ‚Äúscratch‚Äù. 

Nicaragua is a beautiful country, but they have a long way to go to attract more tourists. I felt more hospitality in Cuba which has less infrastructure and accommodations. The food was amazing and the people are friendly, but the government is corrupt and very incompetent. I guess this is what you should expect from one of the poorest countries in the Americas, but it‚Äôs a shame because there‚Äôs so much potential there. ",988,2024-06-19 09:54:18,OG-AG,0.89
18g4njy,Today I saw the impossible on a plane. Flight attendant vs client,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18g4njy/today_i_saw_the_impossible_on_a_plane_flight/,4092,"Fligth attendant walking behind a woman on the aisle and saying she will call the police and that she (the woman) won't be flying because she was rude and said some offensive words to the flight attendant while not complying with the limited number of luggage she was supposed to take with her on the plane.

The woman sits anyways while saying that the flight attendant was being rude first and not understanding that she needs to bring this machine for medical reasons.

A few minutes later the flight attendant goes back to the woman and tells her they are coming to remove her from the plane. The woman talks to her calmly, advised by her husband who is telling her she won't win this fight otherwise. They both have a little chat but very calm and quiet so nobody can listen.

After this the flight attendant goes to the end of the plane and starts crying. A few seconds later the woman stands up and goes to her. They have a hug and a long conversation. She stayed on the plane. I always thought it was impossible for a client to ""beat"" the flight attendant. I guess the flight attendant actually was wrong and admitted to it",204,2023-12-11 15:24:11,djoko_25,0.95

1bd6igr,Americans -- don't ever change,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bd6igr/americans_dont_ever_change/,3803,"Americans‚Äîdon't ever change.

I am writing this post from London, in the United Kingdom. I have just learned that I have become a dual citizen (complicated story), making me British-American, and my first U.S. passport is on its way.

So it got me thinking about all my previous adventures in your one-of-a-kind country, and the thing that stood out most was the sincerity behind the kindness found in each American‚Äôs heart and the spirit of persistence and determination. I have yet to meet a nation with people who are as friendly as they are hard-working, and for that reason, I hope you guys never change.

I have so many memories, moments, and experiences that I wrote down in my diary of my trips to the USA. I distinctly remember my first impressions of arriving in Boston: big houses, flags, yellow school buses, football fields, iconic stop signs, brownstone buildings, chatty waitresses, diners, Walmart, billboards, station waggons, and 7-11s. It was pure, unbridled joy. I remember thinking to myself, ‚ÄúThis country can‚Äôt be real; it‚Äôs so motherfucking cool. Just like the movies, honestly, what a beautiful country."" I was a teenager, so naturally I didn‚Äôt have access to a car, but I had the most amazing time getting lost in Beech Forest in Cape Cod, wandering far from Provincetown. Massachusetts as a state is underrated, I think. Uber drivers being hilarious Dominicans never fails to amuse me, and the town of Newburyport has a special feeling to it, I find, even if the commuter rail schedule is unforgiving for those who miss their trains like me.

I have a million stories to tell, but I will just share some brief reflections: D.C. and Chicago are very underrated cities, both beautiful with great architecture. NYC is NYC; no need to touch upon that; it makes London look like a calm and laid-back city. LA and San Francisco epitomise that cool West Coast vibe, and the coastal towns and cities of California are heavenly. Malibu, Monterrey, Carmel-by-Sea, Santa Barbara, Santa Monica... do I need to go on?

The great state of Texas warrants its own paragraph. I met an Arsenal fan in the little town of Iola; that was an eye-opening experience. Austin is a great city with fun people, and I gave myself a ‚ÄúTexan sunburn‚Äù on my shoulder when I fired a shotgun for the first time in my life. Buccees is a gift from God; don‚Äôt take it for granted. The beaver nuggets and beef jerky are to die for. The little enclave of Marfa in West Texas was simply fascinating; it was such a unique part of the world in my eyes.

Utah, Colorado, and Vermont‚Äîyou guys are little slices of heaven on Earth. I witnessed my first proper thunderstorm in a town called Loa in Utah. I went for a stroll at 1 a.m. in this tiny town, where everyone else was already sleeping, because I wanted to get a feel for the place. I got caught in the rain and decided to make the most of it, so I continued walking around. The thunderstorm caused a power cut for a few minutes, and then it was just me, the howl of the wind, and the crack of lighting. After a few minutes, the bright red sign of Family Dollar lit up, and I became entranced by the neon sign that illuminated the road. I don‚Äôt know why that moment has stuck with me‚Äîmaybe because it was surreal being the only one awake at that hour in a town thousands of miles from home. Colorado and Vermont have to be among the most stunning places on Earth. I have no words to describe the serenity and character the small towns in these states exude. Ouray, Telluride, Breckenridge, Silverton, Stowe, Woodstock...

So I guess what I want to say is thank you for being you, don‚Äôt ever change, and don‚Äôt let anyone else tell you that the USA isn‚Äôt a great country. I believe that life's beauty lies in its messiness and unpredictability, and while the USA has flaws like every other country in the world, there is a reason so many people want to start anew in the USA‚Äîbecause the spirit of hard work, kindness, and authenticity shines through everyday Americans.",545,2024-03-12 14:44:07,chester_ming99,0.89

I'm 34 years old and had never been to the US until this year. I grew up in India so it was far away plus my parents didn't really have the disposable income for a vacation to someplace so far. As an adult when I moved away and started earning my own money, distance was still an issue and I needed a visa on an Indian passport which is a pain to get. I also always thought the US was soulless, lacking culture, boring etc. 

For the past 6 years I've lived in Canada. I became a Canadian citizen last year which means no visa needed. This year, I've traveled to New York state in May (Ithaca), Bay Area in August, Denver in October and Chicago a couple of weeks ago. 4 different states all in 1 year, and they've all been amazing. I love the buzz, the vibe, the people have been great, the food is super and I can't explain but I keep feeling like going back.  The energy of the country is inspiring.

Over the course of a week, we visited Baghdad, the holly cities of Karbala and Najaf, and the ruins of ancient Babylon (where we were the only tourists around).
Backpacking infrastructure does not really exist in the country, however there is an abundance of cheap hotels and shared taxis between different cities are very affordable. 
Locals outside of Baghdad aren‚Äôt very used to seeing western foreigner visitors, so be prepared to be invited for a cup of tea very often. Food‚Äôs good (however not remarkable like Lebanese) and people are very kind and welcoming. Security in the form of military checkpoints and heightened police presence is still very much around and some security concerns remain - which in most cases do not apply for foreign tourists.

I had to run almost all the way to customs to catch the perp trying to walk away. 

Airport security had no interest in taking down a statement or looking into it so hopefully this serves as a PSA to always keep an eye out for your carry-on. I was lucky that the airport was empty and we didnt feed into a domestic lobby, where it would have been much easier to get lost in the crowd.

Edit: adding comments from below. 

When I caught up. He said someone asked him to get it for him because he was sitting in the back of the plane..which doesnt add up because why would you then continue on to customs if you were going to hand it to someone else. I asked for description and he gave a very generic description of a man with tattoos, at which point i gtfo.

He had no carryon of his own, only a backpack so he was fully intended to run away with it..I mean I ran ~200m from the gate to catch up to him, almost to the point of no turnaround.

The most disappointing part of the lack of interest from CBSA or security personnel. I provided timestamps and detailed description but everyone wanted me to email the airlines. As if Flair airlines was going to do anything about it.",555,2023-12-30 14:55:50,phxxx,0.92
1d0s8nq,I got robbed mid flight on my onward Cathay Pacific flight and stopped a robbery on my return flight,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d0s8nq/i_got_robbed_mid_flight_on_my_onward_cathay/,3232,"I was traveling to Hong Kong, the flight was not full. I had my cards in my wallet and money in my travel documents holder. 

After landing at HK and checking into the hotel I realized that a good chunk of my money (I keep my money in different compartments within the wallet just to be safe, so the thief only took from one of the compartments, thinking it‚Äôs all the money I had) and both my cards were missing. I immediately blocked my cards, while I was doing it I saw a failed transaction for 6000 HKD on my debit card. It failed because it didn‚Äôt have that much money (being broke helped, lol). I couldn‚Äôt believe what had happened. I have never experienced lack of safety in a flight. 

I raised a complaint with Cathay Pacific but they said they can‚Äôt do anything and it‚Äôs not their responsibility if I get robbed. The complacency from their side to ensure safe travelling is alarming . Since the money was not a lot and I was only there for 2 days I didn‚Äôt pursue it. 

On my return journey I was extra vigilant. The lady next to me had her backpack placed under the seat in front of her. I saw the man sitting in front of her reaching down and fiddling with the bag. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the lady‚Äôs bag and she was sleeping so I didn‚Äôt want to be made a fool if it was not her bag. Once she woke up and checked her bad I asked her is anything missing. She said her money is missing. I told her the man in front of her took it. She complained to the crew and the crew took her and the thief to the side and was calling security once we landed. I didn‚Äôt stay back to see what happened next as I had to leave. 

Moral: always be diligent and take care of your belongings. Never travel Cathay Pacific. 

Edit: I kept my wallet and passport holder in my backpack which was kept in the baggage compartment above my seat

1dtarfc,11 days in Japan with kids,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dtarfc,3119,"Last November we spent 10 nights in Japan with our two tweens. We made our way from Kyoto to Hakone to Nagano to Tokyo. We had SO much fun and got to enjoy an incredible variety of sights and experiences. I did a lot of research before the trip and everything went really well. I'm putting our detailed itinerary (including transportation, where we stayed and what we ate) here in hopes that it might help some other families.

Day 1
Flew into Kansai airport and took Haruku Express to Kyoto. Checked into Hotel Emion (family room with 4 beds). Walked around the area, relaxed, soaked in the hotel bath house, dinner at a random steak restaurant near the hotel.

Day 2
Hotel buffet breakfast. Uber to Kinkaku-ji (lots of school groups, heard later it is less crowded around sunset), Nijo Castle, Nishiki Market (where we ate lunch), Fushimi Inari (if you keep hiking toward the top the crowd thins out considerably), Kiyomizu-dera (lots and lots and lots of people, delicious little snack places around the area), Gion district for dinner (okonomiyaki).

Day 3
Hotel buffet breakfast. Uber to Adashino Nenbutsuji (bamboo forest with no people), walked down Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street to Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (if you want to avoid the crowds you have to get there at the crack of dawn, which we can't). Entered Tenryu-ji through north entrance, walked through gardens to main entrance. Walked across Togetsukyo Bridge then back. Matcha ramen for lunch. Kimono forest, Randen street car back to town. Kyoto Railway Museum. Dinner at wagyu restaurant in the hotel (discovered that our kids don't like wagyu because they think it's too soft, cancelled plans for wagyu buffet in Tokyo).

Day 4
Hotel buffet breakfast. Kintetsu Limited Express to Nara, then short walk to Nara Park. Did not know that the sacred deer are VERY hungry in the mornings. The moment I bought deer crackers I got swarmed, and bitten on the butt by several deer. Later on we learned that the trick is to immediately put the crackers in your bag, then take them out one at a time. Walked to Todai-ji, lots of deer and vendors along the way. Got ice cream and cute souvenirs. Lunch outside the temple, beef sukiyaki. 1pm Kintetsu Limited Express back to Kyoto. Uber to Nintendo store, short line to take photos on the rooftop. Walked around Gion district and Kenninji Temple. Dinner at tempura restaurant.

Day 5
Hotel buffet breakfast. Checkout. Shinkansen to Odawara. Bought Hakone Free Pass (includes all Hakone transportation, ropeway, pirate ship). Took Hakone Tozan train to Gora station, then taxi to Hakone Hotel Kowakien (family room with 2 beds and 2 futons). Our one night stay included dinner, breakfast, and admission to Yunessun across the street, which is like an onsen waterpark. We left our luggage at the hotel, got our wristbands and swimsuits, and walked over. Kids loved it. We had lunch there. There was an outdoor slide, splash park, caves, lazy river (bring your own float), cool indoor onsens like wine and coffee, and outdoor onsens with a beautiful view. Back to hotel for elaborate dinner buffet. Hotel onsen at night, crowded but I got to soak in a tub under the moon and stars.

Day 6
Very long wait for the hotel buffet breakfast. Checkout. Left luggage at hotel. Took bus to Hakonemachi-ko. Most packed bus I have ever been on in my life and I've taken a lot of public transportation in Asia. Every time we thought surely no more people can fit in this bus, the driver stopped and let more people on. There are two pirate ship ports at the south of Lake Ashi and everyone got off at the first one, Motohakone-ko. There was a huge line of people waiting to get on the first sailing. But we stayed on the bus a little further to Hakonemachi-ko and very few people were there. Boarded 9:30am pirate ship, took pictures of the floating tori and Mt. Fuji. Sailed across Ashinoko and disembarked at Togendai-ko. Took Hakone ropeway to Owakudani, ate black volcanic eggs.

Cable car down to Gora. Taxi back to hotel to pick up luggage then on to Kowakidani station to catch Hakone Tozan train back to Odawara. Shinkansen from Odawara to Tokyo Station to Nagano. Ate bento lunch on the train. Snow Monkey Express to Yudanaka. Shibu Hotel staff picked us up at the station. Checked into hotel at 5:30pm (ryokan family room with 4 futons). Changed into yukatas and walked around town. Back to hotel for kaiseki dinner at 7pm. After dinner headed back out to visit Shibu onsens and get stamps on our souvenir towels.

Day 7
Hotel breakfast in private room. Checked out. Walked around town some more. Hotel shuttle to snow monkey park at 10am. Hike to snow monkeys. Ramen lunch at Enza Cafe at entrance to snow monkey park, apple soft-serve was amazing. Hotel picked us up and dropped us at Yudanaka Station. While waiting for our train we tried the foot bath outside the station. Train to Nagano, then got reserved seats on fastest shinkansen Kagayaki to Ueno station. Checked into Mimaru Tokyo Ueno North (family room with 1 bed and 2 bunk beds). Train to Akihabara for dinner.

Day 8
Pokemon Center and Cafe. Reservation for 10:40am (I paid a guy on Fiverr, very hard to get reservations). Ate possibly our most expensive meal in Japan and watched dancing Pikachu. Shopped in the store. Shinkansen to Yokohama then local train to Gundam Factory (sadly this was a temporary installation and it is gone now). Watched 3 shows. Train back to Shinjuku. Dinner at Isetan dining.

Day 9
Pastries for breakfast then train to Sensoji and Asakusa. LOTS of people. Spent an hour in a hedgehog cafe. Short water cruise then bought bento lunches to eat back at our hotel. Nap. Walked around Ueno area, dinner at Renkon (lotus root restaurant recommended by a Japanese friend).

Day 10
Tokyo DisneySea.

Day 11
Checkout. Stored our luggage at Tokyo station. Train and walked down Ginza to Tsukiji fish market. Ate uni (sea urchin). Train to Shibuya scramble crossing. More ramen for lunch (because our kids really like ramen). Back to Tokyo station to pick up our luggage, take photos in front of the classic station building, then train to airport.

Some notes:
- This is was just before the JR pass price hike so we bought JR pass, but it would not be worth it now.
- Both our kids were real troopers, but we also tried to intersperse culture/sightseeing with fun activities, ultimately it kept everyone happy.
- We ate convenience store ice cream every single day. I still dream about Japanese ice cream, cream puffs too.
- We live in a lot of nature, so in Tokyo with limited time we prioritized city sights rather than parks, though I would've loved to have visited those if we had more days.
- Coming from the US, we found all the food, admissions, and accomodations very reasonably priced. For example, the ryokan experience with Shibu Hotel, with kaiseki dinner and breakfast for 4, multiple pick-ups and drop-offs, was only $500. I have some photos with menu prices if anyone wants to see them.
- The hotel we stayed at in Kyoto is a little out of the way, but we loved it because it was beautiful, uncrowded, breakfast was delicious, and bath house was lovely after a day of walking.
- It was our first time in Japan so we knew we would be visiting all the ""tourist traps"" that are going to be packed with people, and we were fine with that. If (when!) we go again I would love to go to less famous locations and explore.
- None of us speak any Japanese. It was fine. I do read Chinese so was able to understand most signs without resorting to Google translate.
- It was really hot in Japan in early November. REALLY hot. I don't understand how locals we saw on the street were wearing long sleeves and even sweaters. Some indoor places felt like saunas to us because I think they actually turned the heat on.

Some guy working in a restaurant or some guy out in public who had just gotten off of work probably doesn't really want to waste time talking to a tourist but may play along to be polite.

He likes to do more extreme types of backpacking trips, and has on occasion gotten really sick because of a bug bite, or gotten lost and water depleted. He says he's learned since he was younger to be more prepared for those kinds of scenarios, but yeah that's the kind of traveler he is. 

He recently told me he wants to visit Somalia with a friend who's from there. I think this is a horrible idea and it's possible he may die. I recently read a white westerner's travel blog about visiting Somalia earlier this year, and his advice was basically ""don't go"". This is from a person who's traveled to all but 10 countries in the entire world. 

I'm very scared for my cousin and if I'm being honest, I think he'd be ill advised to go. I'm not sure whether/if/how I should try to convince him not to go, and I'm also not sure whether my very limited understanding of the situation over there is accurate. I've read that Somalialand is safer than the rest of Somalia, but I could totally see him wanting to go to places to Mogadishu too. Any advice about how to approach this?

1ci2ddg,Traveling is not the same experience for women as it for men and it's insane what women face around the world,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ci2ddg/traveling_is_not_the_same_experience_for_women_as/,2839,"Anyone who thinks traveling (or just traveling and honestly just existing) for women isn't hard - I urge you to think about the millions of women who face harassment. I myself have been either sexually assaulted, harassed, groped, catcalled heavily or followed in: Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Waterloo, London, Lisbon, Rome, and Naples. I was recently assaulted in Naples and posted about it to let people (esp women) know what can happen and instead I received messages from tons of men telling me I'm ""playing a sad victim"" and that I'm crying about it (I was literally hugged, groped, and kissed today by a total stranger on the street while walking)

It's not easy being a woman and still enjoying things worry free like men can and it sucks we've created a culture and a world where this is prevalent. I'm not saying men don't have to be worried about solo travelling, but women have to be worried about everything men do AND assault on top of that. It's to the point where I can't even go out at night when I have paid to travel to cities, or go to famous landmarks, or bars/clubs, or even take public transport at night. 

On top of that, things like pepper spray and such are illegal in so many countries and harming the other person (as self defence) may even result in the woman being punished if the law deems so. But we need to understand that women cannot defend themselves like men can in situations such as being attacked. We are simply not that strong physically. I know for a fact that I and many other women cannot get a man off us if we tried to. So why are we expecting the same ""self defense"" efforts from men and women? Knowing that using a pepper spray will get me in trouble with the law but the man who raped me can walk away if proven innocent blows my mind. 

I'm tired of following endless precautions yet still being targeted for things like this and assaulted. People are always blaming women too like ""oh you must've dressed wrong"" or ""you must have smiled at him"" and if not blaming women, people will only be giving tips out on what women can do to make sure that they are not assaulted. But WHY are we pinning everything on women and making it their responsibility? Why can't we teach guys that this is not okay by having stringent laws and punishments and just realizing the human factor when it comes to making laws regarding ""self defense"" because unfortunately, women are physically weaker.

I'm tired of hearing that ""this is the culture with [ ] men"" or that my clothes made it seem like ""I wanted it"". Traveling and just this world seems unfair for women and men need to acknowledge their privilege and advocate for changes too. It isn't cool if your buddy assaults me and then you just laugh as if it wasn't a big deal. It isn't cool for you to say that I just shouldn't travel if it's like this. It isn't cool for you to assume that anything I did caused this. ",98,2024-05-01 19:43:52,xrshxa,0.8

So we booked a place to stay one night, booking.com sends a ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù. Get to the place late night and we are emailed another 3rd party app by the owner requesting we upload everyone‚Äôs passports. This wasn‚Äôt clearly requested on the listing but sure in principle it‚Äôs reasonable. The issue is this random 3rd party app doesn‚Äôt work on our phones, and though we repeatedly try uploading our passports (and it‚Äôs sketchy as hell because it‚Äôs some unknown app) we keep getting ‚Äúdenied‚Äù. They refuse a refund.

After about an hour waiting outside I book another place directly for a steep rate cuz it‚Äôs late, submit a ticket on the app for a listing. A week later still no response I call booking, multiple times and over the aforementioned long call, they repeatedly say there is nothing they can do and it is our fault. 

So essentially I pay $150 bucks, show up somewhere and then they the decide to add in a requirement I cannot meet, and there is no refund. For all I know the listing is a total fraud, it doesn‚Äôt exist, and the ‚Äúapp‚Äù requesting our passports simple is designed not to work. Booking.com told me repeatedly it is my responsibility to detect fraud even though they host this persons listings on their site. They provide absolutely no guarantee that what you are booking isn‚Äôt just outright fraud, I asked them if it were hypothetically just fake listings being posted and they essentially said there is nothing they would do in that case, they don‚Äôt care one bit.

1g0xhh0,10 days in portugal - a review ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0xhh0,2550,"Trip update: Lisbon &gt; Lagos &gt; Porto from 9/14 to 9/25

AMAZING trip and I‚Äôm glad we kept our itinerary and didn‚Äôt cut stops (per feedback from an itinerary check I did pre-trip). It was a great first trip / intro to Portugal and absolutely want to come back. 

Things we did and places / meals we tried that I cannot stop raving about:

Lisbon sights:
- [ ] Just wandering around Alfama was super fun
- [ ] Walking down the streets to the Pra√ßa de Comercio was fun, we grabbed bottles of wine and watched the sunset. There‚Äôs a gent building a rock village that was cool to watch 
- [ ] Bel√©m tower is gorgeous 
- [ ] Monastery dos Jeronimos was closed since we went on a Monday but got to walk around the outside and architecture was beautiful 
- [ ] Miradouro da Senhora do Monte was a free and gorgeous lookout point of Lisbon. Amazing vista of the city
- [ ] Walked from the lookout to Castelo de S. Jorge. Cool to walk around the castle ruins. Also really great views of the city. if you can, time it so you‚Äôre there to watch the sunset from their lookout point or in the many towers 

Lisbon eats:
- [ ] Pasteis de nata, had at least one everyday and they are divine 
- [ ] Pateo - Bairro do Avillez - dinner our first night and was excited bc chef has a Michelin star. Really enjoyed it in the moment but looking back, it was our most expensive meal of the trip (still affordable compared to states) but I think we‚Äôve had more authentic meals since. Still a cool experience and ambiance was nice. 
- [ ] Pateo 13 in alfama - recommended by a friend and cash only seafood. Whole sea bass we had was good but was expecting more street food vibes 
- [ ] Da Prata 52 - favorite meal in Lisbon. Amazing Portuguese tapas place with really fun service. 
- [ ] O Castica - laid back but very good food. Shrimp, paella and seafood pasta. 

Sintra day trip
Unfortunately most of the sites were closed due to risk of wild fires so we went to the only two that were open: Biester palace and the national palace. Both were fine but nothing in comparison to wanting to see Pe√±a palace and the Moorish Castle but will just have to come back on another trip!
Had lunch at Romario de Baco and it was fun. Checked out some of their stores and stalls before taking the train back, which was super painless.

Lagos:
Omg I did not expect to love but the vibes are so chill and laid back after the hustle and bustle of Lisbon! 

Lagos sites:
- [ ] Do a cave boat tour, so fun to everything from the water. Recommend going in the morning during low tide so you don‚Äôt miss out on caves 
- [ ] Praia do Camilo - it‚Äôs 229 steps down to the beach (don‚Äôt forget the climb up) but so worth it! We went there two days in a row and were there 10 AM in time for low tide and there when high tide came in. Water is beautiful and sand if soft
- [ ] walk the boardwalk from town to the lighthouse and Ponta da Piedade

Lagos eats:
- [ ] Alma Lusa - absolutely get the octopus rice, I‚Äôm still thinking about that dish. The codfish is delicious (be sure to mix in the cured egg yolk), the sea bass was good and buttery, the mussels were delicious and their grilled octopus was divine
- [ ] Restaurante Prato Cheio - get the pork and clams cataplana. The pork was so tender and the seafood was delicious. Hubby got the mixed fish cataplana and enjoyed it
- [ ] O Camilo - please make a reso whether lunch or dinner otherwise you won‚Äôt get in. The grilled octopus was prob my fave of the trip. The squid was equally fresh and delicious, oysters were nice and briny, and garlic shrimp was amazing. 
- [ ] Repolho Gastrobar &amp; Garrafeira Lagos - had a late lunch so did a lighter tapas only dinner here. The octopus pataniscas, shrimp, peri peri wings and spicy chorizo were pretty solid. 

Porto:
Did not expect to love Porto since it was so foggy and dreary when we landed. Actually, while we were there, most mornings started out that way but ended up clearing up and getting warm by lunchtime. 

Porto things:
- [ ] Day trip to Douro valley was so worth it and fun. Our guide Tiago was amazing and we visited a taberna for breakfast, three wineries (d‚Äôorigem, somewhere in Sabrosa and somewhere in Pinh√£o), a boat tour on the river and lunch. Bought a bottle of 20 year tawny port at our last stop
- [ ] Walking around Ribeiro neighborhood was fun
- [ ] Mercado de Bolh√£o- fun to walk around with a glass of wine and check out the stalls 
- [ ] Wandering by the river and taking the bridge to the other side was fun. Came upon some cool shops, port tasting and vendors by the river 

Porto eats:
- [ ] Gazela to try the OG Portuguese hot dog the cachorrino 
- [ ] Taberna dos Mercadores - 1.5 hr wait in line and that‚Äôs with standing in line 20 mins before they opened. But the octopus rice, salted sea bass, shrimp were all an amazing.
- [ ] Mercado de bolhao - got amazing uni, seafood, meats and cheese while walking around. Wished we found this gem sooner
- [ ] Shiko - amazing Japanese food with fresh seafood. Ceviche - this will live rent free in my head forever. Salmon tataki- solid reco by Pedro and cuts were generous and oh so buttery. Tuna akami roll - great cuts. Unagi - nice and lightly seared. Sashimi - nice cuts of tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Turbot - interested in trying pieces we don't get in the states but this was not my fave
- [ ] Potts and combi for coffee and natas 

Could not even choose a favorite stop if we tried bc every place had its own vibes. Loved Portugal and glad we got to see as much as possible! ",89,2024-10-10 19:31:52,keke1486,0.99

1ggkzwh,Egypt on film!,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggkzwh,2399,"I got to visit Egypt for the first time in October with my husband who is originally from there. Our itinerary was 2 days Cairo, 5 days Nile cruise from Luxor to Aswan, 4 days back in Cairo with husband‚Äôs family + day trip to Alexandria, then finishing off with 3 days Sharm El-Sheikh. Overall we had a great time and seeing these sites in person was surreal!

My husband and I were both pretty nervous about this trip bc we had read all the horror stories about traveling to Egypt, especially as a woman. Things were better than expected in terms of harassment from people selling you things. I learned I had to let go of politeness and just firmly say no thank you and keep walking with no eye contact. I honestly think the people selling trinkets by the Eiffel Tower were more aggressive than the vendors by the sites in Egypt. Men definitely did blatantly stare at me A LOT even though I was dressed modestly, but they never really said anything or tried to touch me (maybe bc I was always with my husband). 

Overall I do highly recommend visiting, but I do think you should do with it a guide and not DIY. There are so many little intricacies with tourist police and permits, etc that it would have been really confusing to navigate, even if you/someone in your group speaks Arabic.

Also the pillows underneath those pillowcases are filthy, covered in yellow/brownish spots, but I‚Äôve only seen that here in South Korea. The ones I‚Äôve seen in the past seemed more waterproof. I‚Äôm grossed out lol, a pillowcase doesn‚Äôt feel like enough to separate myself from that.

SO DETAILED . my brain turned into mush and i was literally walking around with tears in my eyes IT WAS SOOOO BEAUTIFUL i didnt even MIND that there were so many people there THEY WERE EXPERIENCING WITH ME TOO !! i got nauseous really quickly i think its cause i got overstimulated but i kept going because im a trooper and i loved it so much and it was so beautiful and gorgeous and its just so amazing to think that living breathing people like me contributed to that so many years ago and i love humans and i love what we have done even though some of it was bad and i have hope for everyone ever and i cant wait to see future developments . i am so glad i exist because i wouldnt have experienced this otherwise. also italy has very nice foliage i think . we got robbed in rome but ummm . other than that it was epic and i hope those thieves can find a lovely job instead of resorting to theft . bless everyone

18b7cwp,Anyone else experienced weird racism with Singapore airlines?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18b7cwp/anyone_else_experienced_weird_racism_with/,2314,"I generally love SQ so I normally ignore the subtle micro aggressions but my flight yesterday felt like I was being pranked. 

Flew from Sydney to Singapore and despite the extremely busy airport, the ground crew was amazing. I chose the aisle seat next and had a lovely Caucasian lady and her pre-teen daughter next to me. I started noticing immediately that the crew would initially ask questions only to the lady and move on (‚ÄúAny drinks for you Ma‚Äôam?‚Äù) and I had to call them back for water. 

The strange thing happened during the first meal time. They bought out the daughter‚Äôs meal first and then the lady‚Äôs standard chicken meal. I thought it makes sense because of special dietary requirements and family and all. Two hours passes and they‚Äôre cleaning up and I politely remind the crew lady in my area that I never received a meal. She looked surprise and provides a hasty apology and says she‚Äôll look into it after clean up. Nothing happens. I‚Äôm starving and realised they forgot about me again when they start serving the refreshments (more than 6 hours into the flight). The lady notices and complains on my behalf as my stomach is actually growling now. A senior male crew member joins then and apologises profusely, mostly to her but also somewhat to me? Turned out that they ran out of most of the food option and asked if I was ok with a vegetarian meal. I said yes as I‚Äôm that hungry then. I never got the refreshment meal or an offer of that in the end. 

While the missed meal part was the worst, throughout the whole flight, I think I never had more of a challenge to get service. I used the call button 4 times for water and got ignored. The lady had to order 3 water every time to make sure I actually stayed hydrated. 

I fly with SQ about thrice a year and this was the first time the service was ever this bad. The funny thing is, all the crew members on this flight looked South Asian and I am of Indian descent so I‚Äôm not even sure if this is a whole ‚Äúwe can ignore her, she‚Äôs one of us‚Äù thing. Either way, very unpleasant experience and not sure what to do with it.",501,2023-12-05 02:16:56,ann-und-cover,0.88

However, I've just found out that Airbnb reservation can be canceled by a host just like that, two days before arrival. ""Here's your refund, off you go"". Mind you, this is Memorial weekend - everything is booked, prices are through the roof by now.

If we cancel a booking from Expedia or any other OTA (say, due to a rare overbooking situation, an issue with a room or something), the OTA looks for an alternative and we have to cover the guest's relocation cost to a comparable (or better) resort. Not the case with Airbnb - you get zero support, you're on your own.

So imagine: you have a flight overseas with your family and friends, and boom - the host cancels :) I'm definitely going to be more careful when booking Airbnb in the future - now that I know this is their policy.

What's also interesting is that Airbnb actually charges the host a hefty penalty for the cancellation, they just keep the money while you're left to overpay for your stay now :)))",496,2024-05-23 20:37:21,Pinkey79,0.94

1gplkw9,Machu Picchu via one-day Inka Trail,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gplkw9,2286,"Many people want a taste of the Inka Trail, but may not have time or physical conditioning to do the entire four day trek (or maybe the want a shower).  There is fortunately another option!  The one day inka trail.  Since I just completed it, I thought I would share some insights. 

1) the Inka trail is highly controlled for number of people.  You *will* need to book in advance.  You will need a guide/group to go.  And you have to have the passport you booked with because the checkpoints verify your access using that number (if you update your passport before travel, bring your old passport or work with your guide/travel agent to update your booking to your current passport number)

2) Out of 7 miles, you will only be on *the* inca trail for the last ~3 miles.  The four day trail and the one day meet up just past the ruins of Winay Wayna.  You will still pass through the sun gate for that first magical view of Machu Picchu 

3) yes, the trail is only 7 miles and caps out at ""only"" 8,500 feet.  That makes it worlds easier than the 4-day trek.  But this is NOT an easy hike.  The first three and a half hours are just up up up through hot and humid jungle.  After passing the waterfall, Winay Wayna is the hardest part of the first half, with the ruin involving ~330 steep, uneven steps.  After this is the lunch spot, the only bathroom, and the campsite.  The second half is easier, gentler ups and downs, with only the ""monkey steps"" being the hardest challenge.  These are 50 high stairs that are so steep most people use their hands to climb too.  Finally, the sun gate isn't the end, you still have 45 - 60 minutes down to Machu Picchu and the busses down

4) there is no drinkable water on this trail.  You will need to carry two liters of water, a Gatorade, snacks, a packed lunch, sunblock, bug repellent, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, rain gear, a hat, and sunglasses.  ",106,2024-11-12 08:10:59,NovusMagister,0.99

I know Brazil sometimes doesn‚Äôt have the most easily ready travel information.  Also when I say ten days in Brazil I really mean 8 because Brazil is a looooong away from the US and two days were basically just travel 

Pictures 1-5:  Beach and a wedding venue in S√£o Sebasti√£o.  Beautiful place and quite quiet during the winter but still warm enough to swim for those of us who get real winter!

Pictures 6-7:  Historic town of Paraty which has a really neat vibe and is worth a visit.  We drove up on our way to Rio but it‚Äôs far enough away from everything I wouldn‚Äôt do this as a day trip in general.

Picture 8:  Ipanema beach facing the Two Brothers hills.  I didn‚Äôt feel at all unsafe here or Copacabana even after dark.  Everything is well lit and pretty busy.

Picture 9:  Michelin rated sushi place in Ipanema (for US reference this was $55 with tip)

picture 10:  one of three species of monkeys we saw all over Rio when in the forested areas 

Picture 11: Pedra do Telegrafo.  Great little hike to an optical illusion rock (although I was expecting it to be super safe and it was a little dicey haha, just not as scary as the pictures would indicate!). Loved the story that it gets its name from Instagram.  Before it was unnamed but when social media started tagging it they used the name of the nearest names rock (telegraph rock) and tagged it as such.  It stuck and now it co-opted the name!

Picture 12-13:  sugarloaf mountain.  Great views up there.  We went with a tour because we had some safety concerns but that was a mistake.  It would be better to just Uber over there and take your time enjoying as it was very safe.

Picture 14:  Christ the redeemer.  No need to explain this.  Definitely feels touristy though as it‚Äôs always packed.  Take the cog train up 

Picture 15:  this was our most authentic Brazilian experience as we made our way alone to a Botafogo match.  Absolutely wild crowd as the defeated Palmeiras 2-1.  Totally chaotic compared to American sports.  Buying tickets on the phone was an adventure (if you try make sure you have one ticket per phone as entrance is connected to a facial scan.

Some incredible street art in Glasgow and im so glad we made it to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery &amp; Museum (things like this are never free where I live). We took a walk through Pollok Country park and saw some highland cows after ironically not seeing any in the highlands.

Lowlights: 

We didn‚Äôt make it to the Fairy Pools because a couple cars were too scared to drive through a large puddle and some mud. Road was too narrow and everyone behind them had to reverse. 

Nowhere to eat on Skye if you don‚Äôt reserve a table days ahead. Not enough gas stations.

1clqkrn,My sister's experience in Pakistan.,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1clqkrn/my_sisters_experience_in_pakistan/,2112,"Hello, everyone. My family and I live in Canada.

Last year, in February, my mom and sister (12F) went to Pakistan. Unfortunately, my sister got **extremely** sick within the first few days after arriving there.  She stayed in a hospital for a week, where she was given a little too much antibiotics (we found out it was way too much because the doctors told us when they came back to Canada).

She recovered for a few days, went back home, and suddenly, while they were out with family in Lahore, she had **severe pain** in her back and stomach.  My sister was almost unconscious because of the pain. My mom immediately took her back to the doctor's hospital, where they did an ultrasound after giving her injections for the pain. They diagnosed her with a gallbladder stone. My mom was extremely surprised because she was very young and healthy. It was really shocking, and a family member of mine (who was with my mom and sister, and also a doctor) told the doctors to do another ultrasound.

The doctors did another ultrasound but returned with the same conclusion; they told my mom to immediately admit my sister for surgery. By now, their flight back home was only a week away.  My mom asked my dad and my doctor relative to which they all decided to refuse the doctor and wait until we get back home to do a surgery for many reasons. My sister continued to have random attacks of severe pain even after they arrived to Canada. *My mom was actually* ***almost*** *going to allow them to do the surgery because of how much pain she was in, as both my parents were distraught from seeing her in pain.*

In Canada, my parents took her to the emergency room where they did an ultrasound. Strangely, everything was perfect and there was absolutely nothing wrong with her gallbladder or stomach. No stone. The doctors here told us that the lack of good bacteria, due to the amount of antibiotics given to her when she first got sick, was causing her the severe pain. My mom was very shocked and showed him all the reports. The Canadian doctor was very shocked as to why the doctors in Pakistan diagnosed her with this, even worse, going to do surgery!

After taking probiotics due to the doctor's recommendations, she is fortunately okay now. She is perfectly fine!

Now, it's been more than a year, and when we think about this, we just shiver at the thought of getting my little sister operated on for no reason. This was something that my mother and sister experienced last year and I just wanted to know what people thought of it, because it was VERY shocking to us. It was a traumatizing experience for both my mother and sister. (By the way, they knew they were from Canada. Idk if this is relevant)

On our recent tour in May we visited both Lake Como (pics to follow in a separate post) and Lake Garda. In direct comparison, Lake Garda has more to offer and feels more diverse: while Riva dem Garda in the far north, with a stunning mountain backdrop, feels much like an alpine Austrian town and attracts many hikers, Sirmione on the southern shore has an undeniably Italian vibe to it.

1cn7s4g,Morocco Report‚Ä¶ not as bad as described?,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cn7s4g,1871,"‚ÄúHello my friend, where you from?‚Äù

Not sure if they are trying to clean up their image, but Moroccans were not as aggressive as I‚Äôve seen described.  Just for context, am American, been to 30ish countries mostly in Latin America, Europe and Asia, and I‚Äôm traveling with my wife. Our itinerary was mixed‚Ä¶ most of it was on our own, some of it guided.

We flew to Tangier and had a private driver to Chefchaouen. We stayed at a small Riad there. From there we took a CTM bus to Fes. From Fes we rented a car and drove to Merzouga to Tinghir, to Ait Ben-Haddou and then finally to Marrakech. 

Overall I have mixed feelings about Morocco. The rural Moroccans were lovely, however I have no interest in ever returning to Fes or Marrakech.  The souks, while overwhelming of the senses, are fascinating, however it still feels shallow after about 45 minutes. It‚Äôs the same shit everywhere. Rugs, leather, lanterns, and fake brand wear.  The food I feel the exact same way about.  It‚Äôs all generally good, nothing blew me away, and it‚Äôs generally the same everywhere you go. And oh my god, so much bread.

 I got a couple of ‚Äúthe Medina is closed my friend‚Äù scam attempts. One guy said fuck you when I ignored his scam in Marrakech. I bribed one police officer ($10), A taxi driver did a soft scam by dropping us off early. The worst harassment was in Fes, during a guided tour, where a local guide the Riad recommended took us to a rug store, leather store, etc. the shop keepers were relentless. We ended the tour early after he took us to an overpriced lunch spot.  After that we mostly opted to do things on our own and we have no regrets.  On our own, the shopkeepers moved on with a simple no.  I would say it wasn‚Äôt much more aggressive than parts of Mexico, Colombia or Cambodia. 

Lastly, on the issue of harassment of women. My wife was mostly treated fine at worst she was sometimes ignored.  One young boy, maybe 12, tried to grab her ass and she noticed and swatted him away.  She didn‚Äôt feel as welcomed but it wasn‚Äôt terrible, but she has no interest in returning to Morocco. There were little things like only seeing boys out and about playing, she‚Äôd always ask ‚Äúwhere are the girls?‚Äù Moroccans will go out of there way to tell you women are equal, and it‚Äôs not true. Im sure it‚Äôs better than many Muslim countries, but they are not treated equally. It‚Äôs just ingrained in the culture.  I have four step daughters and I would not encourage them to visit without a boyfriend, husband, etc.

For the positives. The Atlas Mountains and the deserts are stunning.  The people in these regions are very friendly, the pace of life is just slower. It‚Äôs was very relaxing driving through some of these remote desert and mountain roads and villages.  I probably won‚Äôt return, but if I do ever do it would be to explore more of rural Morocco.",180,2024-05-08 10:44:52,modninerfan,0.96
1gf1dn0,"Despite six months of planning, my passport, wallet, and $2,000 were stolen just 24 hours before my flight to Gabon‚Äîbut I miraculously made it with one hour to spare. Here are some pictures from Gabon.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gf1dn0,1832,"Additional context:

I planned this trip for 6 months, but 24 hours before my flight, everything went wrong.

My passport, credit cards, and $2,000 in cash were stolen by the cleaning lady at my Airbnb ‚Äî less than 24 hours before my international flight to Gabon.

Losing the money sucked, but what REALLY sucked was losing my passport, along with the Gabonese visa I needed to enter the country üòµ

With less than 12 hours before takeoff, while waiting for the police to take a report, I found myself digging through nearby trash cans, hoping against hope to find it.

I was about to give up when something caught my eye. 

Could it be? 

I untied a trash bag and saw it ‚Äî my wallet, buried in a pile of garbage.

My hands shook as I opened it. 

The passport and cards were still there.

The money? Gone, obviously. 

The cleaning lady had discarded my AirTag and the wallet with my passport and just kept the money.

My brother rushed through traffic and got me to the airport with just 1 hour until my flight.

I thought I was safe, but the airline refused to check my bags since I was the last passenger to arrive.

After explaining the madness of the last 24 hours, I convinced an employee to help.

He agreed to check my (overweight, panic-packed) luggage but warned me it probably wouldn‚Äôt arrive on time.

I sprinted through security, making it onto the plane as the very last passenger ‚úàÔ∏è

I couldn‚Äôt believe I had made it.

The flight was 24 hours long ‚Äî so I had plenty of time to reflect on the chaos.

Then, when I arrived in Gabon, my luggage was delayed for an entire week because it was stuck in Istanbul.

**Moral of the story**: _Even when everything seems to fall apart, trust that resilience and a bit of luck can carry you through. Travel isn‚Äôt just about the destination‚Äîit‚Äôs about embracing the unexpected twists that make the journey unforgettable_ ‚ù§Ô∏èüëäüèΩüòéüîÆ

1884v6n,Some advice from Indian woman about traveling in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1884v6n/some_advice_from_indian_woman_about_traveling_in/,1824,"I see a lot of posts here about people and especially woman about their experiences in India and i thought as an Indian woman who has lived in quite a lot of towns and cities in India growing up, I'll share some of my thoughts on it. 

Majority of travelers who come to India end up doing the Golden Triangle route. This contains states of UP, Rajasthan and Delhi and it's surroundings. Personally, as someone born and raised in India, I would simply never recommend solo travel in this area for woman. I would also not recommend traveling in groups of 2-3 here. I've never heard any group of women here ever deciding to travel to these regions alone. If not for work and jobs, woman do not like these place to live. And we are certainly very careful while making any travel plans in this area. For the most part we either book tours or avoid it. 

To give some context, the North and central India basically has pretty high population density and also pretty high crime rate against woman. The stats don't show how bad it is because majority of it isn't even reported in these areas. I've lived here with family for few years and even as a teenager I never felt safe going out alone even in broad daylight. The stares and touching and lack of personal space is very uncomfortable. It never felt safe. Even when my family use to go out in a car we still prefered to never be in lonely places and come back in a city by evening. 

But i understand there are a lot of beautiful places in the area. So i highly recommend tours here. Please book a package tour in this area. It doesn't cost all that much and you will be able to enjoy India without suffering from harassment. There are a lot of woman only tours too who take extra care. People often travel in these areas in tours or with family or large groups. 

North East and South India are far more safer places to be. Even Extreme north like Uttrakhand and Himachal are safer. These places are pretty, and have far better developed tourist infrastructure. And they offer equally good authentic Indian experience. Still don't stay out at night and don't go to lonely places but yeah, it's safer here and your chances of experience harassment is far far lower here. Metros are the only place where i recommend staying out till 9-10 PM and again not in lonely places.

Also, generally speaking for everyone, India can be pretty overwhelming to travel without a plan. So have a plan. Please have a plan and don't think of just making one up as you go. We don't have tourism infrastructure as developed as the SEA or Europe which are both very backpacker friendly. Here you need a plan. And i genuinely think that tours are just a better way to enjoy India. They tune out a lot of the noise and you can have a better experience and probably won't get sick too because they'll take you to better places for food and everything. You have tours of every type. If you like architecture or adventure and nature or trekking, you will always see tours catering to different audience. Or book a private cab from a reputed tour company so that you can feel assured about your safety and go where you want to go too. 

I would also recommend the city tours that the city organises as those are often pretty safe and cheap and they get you around everything. I personally use the day trip tours organised in cities to get an overview of the place, how close or far it is, how many people are there and how safe it felt and then use the next day to go back and spend time in places I liked and felt safe. 

Another tip about traveling in public transport will be to use female only compartments in metro and trains. Unless and until you are traveling with a male companion I would not recommend anything but female compartment. And even when traveling with your partner, I would recommend that you pick a end where the woman can stand and the man can sort of shield her. That's how we normally travel in general compartments. But yeah, woman only compartments in public transport please. üôèüôè

I think avoiding North and central India and using tours or private vehicles can significantly make your travel in India better and safer. And it doesn't cost much too.",216,2023-12-01 00:14:01,NarglesChaserRaven,0.96

I was traveling to attend my best friend's wedding, which I had both the time and resources to do. Upon arrival at the port of entry, I encountered an immigration officer who made the whole process quite challenging.

Initially, the officer asked routine questions like my name, where I intended to stay, and the purpose of my visit, to which I promptly replied that I was attending my friend's wedding. However, things took a turn when they began probing further, asking for details about my friend's name and whereabouts, which I was able to answer questions about my friend's name (the one getting married), who is driving me there, which city, and state they are getting married in, his job, and his wife's name. However, I couldn't provide details about the my driving friends salary, or the exact annual income of my friend and his wife, his wife's occupation, nor the precise location of their wedding and where they live as well with exact address, other bullshit question like.

Because of this, the officer disappeared for what felt like an eternity, leaving me anxious as I had a connecting flight to catch in just two hours. I had hoped to grab a quick meal at the airport during the layover, but the delay was putting everything at risk.

Upon their return, the questioning intensified, delving into my friend's occupation and when we had last met, which started to feel intrusive and unnecessary. Frustration got the better of me, and I expressed my urgency, emphasizing the impending flight and the need to expedite the process.

Unfortunately, my impatience seemed to aggravate the situation, leading to further interrogation and even suggestions of terrorist affiliations with North Korean government and CCP, which felt completely baseless and discriminatory, given that I South Korean nationality.

3 Hours passed, and not only did I miss my connecting flight, but I also endured a prolonged wait of six more hours for next connecting flight due to the immigration process. It was a frustrating and exhausting experience, highlighting the inefficiencies and rigidity within the US immigration system.

1grbkgt,11 days in Kenya ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1grbkgt,1748,"My husband and I spent a few months traveling Africa earlier this year, with Kenya being our sixth country. We spent 11 days there, and happened to arrive about a month after devastating floods happened that totally threw out our original itinerary. We ended up spending 5 days in Nairobi while we reassessed our situation, which ultimately was fine but a little long for our liking. We then spent one night in the Limuru area to learn about tea growing and production (fascinating!), then headed to Samburu Nature Reserve for four days safari with a rented SUV. 

We self-drove and camped in Samburu with a rooftop tent. Was an awesome experience! We had self-drove safari three times prior to this so had the general understanding down of how to go about it, but Samburu was a bit more challenging purely because the elephants were able to hide so well. They're absolutely massive beasts but some of the grove areas are too, never got close enough to be truly dangerous (unlike MANY of the professional guided drivers, they get within feet of them, have to make their clients happy I guess just felt wrong) but had to be far more cautious. We kept being told we'd get lost as it can be a maze with bushy dirt roads, but amazingly Google Maps had a surprisingly accurate layout of the area. It can be worthless for a lot of rural Africa but somehow was spot on for Samburu. It would've took effort to get lost regardless, ultimately it's open enough to have bearings at all times. 

We spent one night at the reserves campsite, it was right on the Ewaso river which was wonderful (monkeys galore) but the bathrooms were so ick nasty, had actual bats flying around in them, giant spiders and super dirty. We switched after and stayed the remainder at the Lion King Safari Bush Camp where they let us camp in their brush area, and more importantly let us use their tented bathrooms (huzzah!) as they didnt have any guests during low season. Incredible hospitality, highly recommend purely just to hang with Mike, their guest coordinator who grew up in Samburu. We had elephants fighting near our camp at night, heard lions. Found fresh elephant poop right next to our car one morning. It did feel like a truly wild experience! They had someone patrolling at night to keep watch for animals but I still would have genuinely been nervous to go to the bathroom at night.

While Kenya wasn't our favorite country on the journey, we did walk away with the most impressionable interactions with people. It's tourist heavy so the prices were much higher, and it hands down was the most expensive safari (out of 7) even with self-drive. The driving on the highways was also batshit insane, we drove in 8/10 of the African countries we went to and nothing else was on the level of Kenya, madness! Still a great experience though, what the essence of traveling is all about.

1crh55g,I'll never use booking.com ever again - and you should not either,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1crh55g/ill_never_use_bookingcom_ever_again_and_you/,1744,"Just a rant - sorry. We booked a hotel for the total solar eclipse way ahead of time (December 17th). The hotel called me a month before the eclipse (outside of [booking.com](http://booking.com) communication channels) and requested that I approve a date change (because they just realized they are overbooked). Obviously to a date outside the eclipse. I declined.  
They send me an email through the [booking.com](http://booking.com) system with a one-click ""please confirm if you‚Äôd like to cancel this booking"" link, followed immediately with a ""YOUR ROOM RESERVATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED"".

I called the hotel to complain and they told me to contact [booking.com](http://booking.com) - the hotel claimed it's the mistake of [booking.com](http://booking.com) because they advertised a wrong rate.

So I contacted [booking.com](http://booking.com) - and I was not prepared for how terrible their customer support is.

It took me hours on the phone, multiple managers and superviors, emails and call backs to finally reach someone who was ""allowed"" to make a decision on the case. I was told on the phone that I can book a new hotel of the same class, and [booking.com](http://booking.com) will refund the difference in price. Just a month out from the solar eclipse, any other hotel was obviously way more expensive now - over $300 more expensive to be exact. This was communicated to [booking.com](http://booking.com) multiple times. And this was acknoledge by [booking.com](http://booking.com) multiple times on the phone.

Because of the messy experience over the few days with their customer support, I requested the resolution in writing. I was told I will receive an email confirmation and we ended the call. Again, I was not prepared for how terrible their customer support is. The email I received stated:

&gt;!We are happy to see that¬†your¬†trip is back on track!¬† We can work on a refund for the price difference of your stay,¬†up¬†to a¬†maximum¬†of 25 EUR.!&lt;

I called them again, for the 20th time (not exaggurating) - and I still feel bad for the poor representative that day. It ended up being a 3 hour call of ""No call backs. No more bullshitting. Get whomever you need on the phone to sort this shit out now."" ... which actually worked, which is the saddest part of the story. I don't want to be rough and rude to people to arrive at a resolution. The result was an email stating:

&gt;!We can work on a refund for the price difference of your stay,¬†up¬†to a¬†maximum¬†of 361.69 USD. All you need to do is send us the invoice for your alternative accommodation.!&lt;

So I did. 4 weeks ago, just a week after the eclipse, I forwarded the $333.50 invoce via a response to the email I received from [booking.com](http://booking.com), which had a custom support sender address linked to my account, booking reference in the subject, everything. I gave them a May 1st due date to process the refund. And waited. To no avail. No response. No refund.

So I called them. And again I was unprepared for how shitty they are.

Call 1: They (pretended to?) be unable to hear me and hung up.

Call 2: Friendly, to the point, understood the issue, claimed they never received anything, gave me a new email address to send documents to. I did, they acknoledged that my email was received, I asked for a one-liner in response to confirm in writing that the email was received. ""absolutely, give me just a minute"" was followed by 30 minutes of silence and the call got disconnected. No email was received.

Call 3: They (pretended to?) be unable to understand what my issue was, claimed they have to get in contact with the refunds department, I was placed on hold music mid sentence, and the call was disconnected 20 minutes later.

Call 4: Friendly, request for a supervisor was declined because she wanted to try and help me first, took a bit more time to make them understand the issue, but in the end she said she will be able to send me an email confirmation and asked if she can put me on hold - I declined, because I was hung up on two times tonight while being on hold. So I listened to her typing for 20 minutes. She told me that she sent the email to me and wanted to disconnect the call. I asked her to wait on the line until I actually receive the email, and her immediate response was: &gt;!oh, sorry, I sent it to the wrong email address, my mistake.!&lt;

She corrected her mistake(?) and I received the email saying ""We received your latest email regarding the documents for the¬†refund.""

...and how was your evening?

You only learn how good a company is if things go wrong. The way [booking.com](http://booking.com) handled issues tells me that I will never book anything through them ever again. Be warned.",358,2024-05-13 21:14:31,gulbrillo,0.9

1bwobox,tired of digital nomads acting like moving to another country will solve all their problems,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bwobox/tired_of_digital_nomads_acting_like_moving_to/,1722,"For context, I'm in my early 20s from the US and mostly stay in hostels when I travel abroad. This is a rant because I feel like no one is talking about this. 

I noticed the past two years or so there is an influx of 20-30 year olds who move from wealthy and developed countries, especially like the US and Australia, to countries in Latin America and SEA to work remotely with a job from their home country. I feel like so many hostel common rooms are full of people working on laptops and so many cafes get filled up with people hogging an entire table for hours with just one drink or something. I know it's always the loudest that stand out, but I've heard so many people telling other people ""I travel full time"" and ""my job lets me travel the world"" and how much their life has improved since leaving the US/Canada/Australia/wherever. How life in x country is so much cheaper, more relaxed, more exciting, etc. I have started seeing this sentiment a lot on social media too. I went on a hike recently and I was literally one of three in a group of 14 who wasn't a ""content creator"" or ""expat."" I feel at like my most recent hostel stay I was the only one who had a regular 9-5 career job! Again I say this because it can be hard to relate to other solo travelers when this is the case.

Opinions on digital nomading aside, I find it so shortsighted to say that quality of life in El Salvador or Cambodia is 1000x better than one's home country where you earn your foreign salary and ""live like a king"" in a country where the exchange rate favors your home currency. They say stuff like how life is so much more relaxing and slow paced and has a better community feel. Which sure, one of the reasons we travel is to experience how other cultures live, which is great, but it's kinda ridiculous to claim that solely moving to a new country allowed you to be so zen and healthy. Talk to people who are actually native to these countries and tell them how ""slow paced"" their life is where they need to work 3 jobs just to make ends meet or where you can't even get a good grade school education without family wealth.

Of course your quality of life is better in Argentina when you can afford a luxury penthouse, to eat out multiple times a day, etc. But for example the local Argentinians are not living that lifestyle. Like, please come back to me and tell me your quality of life is better than in the US or EU when you're earning the equivalent of $200 USD a month on an average Argentine's salary.

I met this girl in a hostel saying that Spain is sooo much more affordable and she is so much more relaxed living there than she ever was in the US. She worked 15 hrs a week for her American university exchange program and her ""basic needs"" budget was ""only 50% of her income."" Spanish people are not working jobs like that. I'm a middle class worker in the US and I also spend 50% on my income on basic needs. I also ADORE my job, it's literally my dream job right now. This isn't a country issue, its a budgeting and job issue.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm sick of people acting like their life in the US/Canada/Australia is so horrible and everything magically changed once they took their $70k US salary to Mexico. Of course it did. It's not the ""magic of the food"" and the ""kindness of the locals,"" although of course this is why we have a great time on vacations, your quality of life is better because you have money there. And wherever you go, there you are. Living in a foreign country is a great experience but it isn't gonna solve all your problems, it will just present different ones. Not saying you can't be a better fit for loving in other countries, but let's be realistic and honest here.

EDIT: someone reported me to the reddit crisis hotline?? Seriously? Really not grasping why everyone is so offended by this post

EDIT 2: Everyone saying oh people being happy doesn't harm other people, it does. Look at Lisbon, Medellin, and other ""digital nomad hotspots"" being gentrified to the point of pushing locals out since they can't afford housing there anymore. Some people in the comments come from that side of being from those cities and explain how they are experiencing the effects of people taking their foreign salary there. The local peoples' salaries are not increasing because some Canadians are spending money there. Just because you feel economic stress does not mean you are entitled to add economic stress to foreign communities when you contribute little to the community you're in. This post wasn't meant to target digital nomads in the beginning but with the comments saying why am I so concerned and who cares I just gotta highlight this.",599,2024-04-05 12:48:41,[deleted],0.82

I had a flight today at 10:10AM today. So I went to the screen with all the flights and found the 10:10AM flight to my destination city and head to that gate. When it comes time to board I scan my pass and the agent tells me I‚Äôm not scheduled on this flight. A bit confused I ask her if she has any more information and she looks at my phone and tells me I‚Äôm flying on a different airline.

I used a third party app for my boarding pass and therefore it just said to check the gate at the airport. (First and last time Il ever do this)

Apparently two flights with two different airlines were going to the same city at the exact same time. My flight was on the other side of the airport so I didn‚Äôt make it and had to rebook at my own expense. The last minute 45 minute one way trip ticket cost me more than the round trip multi city flights for my initial tripüò¢

1fso6rm,12 days in Egypt - March 2024 - A childhood dream come true! ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fso6rm,1691,"Fulfilled a childhood dream and visited Egypt for 12 days earlier this year. It was such an assault on the senses, and we were completely awestruck by all of the ancient history!

We split the trip in 3 parts - Cairo, Luxor and Aswan - all for 4 days each. The pictures are in that order as well. Though 20 photos are way too less to share everything! 

Cairo involved a lot of the museums, the mosques and islamic architecture everywhere, some nice city stuff to do as well (including shipping at Downtown Cairo), Coptic Cairo which was an unexpectedly beautiful experience and of course, trips to Giza to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 

Luxor (by far our favourite city in Egypt) involved a lot of walking, the absolutely mind blowing Luxor and Karnak temples, the temples and tombs on the West Bank (2 whole days is needed for this!) and also a bucket list was ticked off with a nice hot air balloon ride! 

On the way to Aswan we did the Edfu (Horus) and Kom Ombo (Crocodile) temples which were stunning! 

Aswan was more laid back. We stayed on the Elephantine island so had to take a ferry from the city ports every day which was such a fun experience. On the island itself, everything was basically accessible by walk. We took boat rides to visit a few of the spots such as the tombs of nobles, the botanical gardens and the colorful Nubain villages! A day trip to the Abu Simbel temples was long and tiring, but oh so worth it. 

Tips:

1. Everything during Ramadan closes early, especially in Cairo. This was an impulse trip of sorts so we didn't actually plan for Ramadan.

2. If you're under 30, make sure to use a student ID (no one checks it too much so we got by with a few edits to our old IDs - don't judge, we try to save wherever we can!) 

PS: Not sure why some of the pictures seem a bit pixelated on the post. They seem perfectly fine on my gallery. Apologies!

The trip was costly - but it was a decision on my own part, and wasn't surprising. I stayed in a hotel instead of hostel despite the price difference, and took organized day trips out of Reykjavik, which also added to it. The point was to try to take the hassle out of driving and also staying more comfortably, despite the prices. 

However, a lesson i learned is that if i ever visit again, I would want to rent a car. The trips were convenient and we'll organized, no fault on their part, but I think the experience of driving through the scenery, stopping where I please and having as much time as I want in each stop, is very needed in Iceland (compared to some other places I visited, where it didn't feel like that as much).

I can't begin to describe what a pain in the ass he is. First, the complaining. He complains constantly. It's too hot. It's too cold. Too sunny. Oh no -- a drop of rain! He's hungry (I'll get to the food in a minute). He's tired. This hurts. That hurts. Just literally an unending torrent of whining.

We're in Europe. People walk places. He hates walking. He's young and in good health. But he starts bitching after like two blocks. He doesn't even want to carry his backpack half the time.

He has no patience with museums and other touristy stuff. We went to the Vatican and had to rush through it because he just couldn't handle it. The Sistine Chapel? Zero interest. Zilch. Nada. Michelangelo might as well have just painted the ceiling beige.

Although the trip was our treat, he has no concept of a budget. He doesn't offer to pay for anything, and he is constantly asking us to purchase things for him.

And don't get me started on the food. We're in arguably the world's greatest food paradise, and he only shows any interest when we pass a restaurant that has a picture of a cheeseburger on the tourist menu. In Rome, we ordered caccio e pepe because we know he likes mac and cheese. He actually spat out his first bite. He'll eat pizza, but only if we order it without toppings.

On top of all that, he won't leave us alone for even a minute. He is constantly in our face, dashing all hope of stealing a few romantic moments for ourselves.

I'd be lying if I said it hadn't crossed my mind to cut him loose so we could enjoy the rest of our vacation by ourselves. But he's our 5-year-old son and it has been an absolute joy and privilege to be able to share this experience with him!",112,2024-04-18 06:59:01,eddie964,0.94

But the last few times i've flown them, their customer service has not been great.  This morning was a prime example.

I had a 730 am scheduled flight DCA to ORD, with a one hour connection there.  Boarding was scheduled to begin at 6:55.

7:15, we were still not boarding.  No announcement of any kind from the three gate agents there.  A minute later, i get a message on the AA app that the flight is delayed 20 minutes.

 7:40, i get another message that the flight is delayed to 8:20.  Still not a peep from the gate agents. 

I went up to the counter and said, ""i'm getting messages that the flight is delayed 50 mins. I'll miss my connection.  Can you please see about rerouting me?""

""Just refresh the app--it will show you all available rebooking options.""

""I did that.  It says the next available option is this same flight tomorrow.  That doesn't work for me.""

""You'll need to go to Cusomer Service .""

Customer service: ""next available is tomorrow. ""

""That doesn't work for me.  Surely you can reroute me from here to Seattle, Denver, DFW, to my destination, either on AA or your partner Alaska.""  

""You'll have to call our help line.""

I ended up calling our travel manager to just rebook me on another airline for flights 6 hours later.

My original flight was ultimately almost 2 hrs late leaving.  At no point did any gate agent make an announcement about the fact of or reason for the rolling delays.

Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! My hope in sharing this info is to show that you can travel to some amazing places on a budget! 

The two of us worked for a few years after graduating from university and saved as much money as we could. We paid for everything ourselves (except the 10 days of accommodation my girlfriend's parents paid for). 

This is just one person's spend and we split everything we can (accommodation, taxi, groceries, etc). I'd love to answer any questions about the budget or destinations. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

**IN TOTAL I SPENT $24,866.42 or $43.55 per day. $6.05 over my planned budget of $37.50 per day.** 

THIS INCLUDES ACCOMMODATION AND FLIGHTS!!!

Some details about the categories:

Accommodation - In Europe: Airbnb/Booking.com is our primary accommodation provider, but we stay in hostels \~30% of the time. 

In Asia: we did not use Airbnb, primarily Agoda/Booking.com/Couchsurfing/Hostels/Guesthouses

Activities - This can be museums, renting motorbikes, group tours, etc.

Coffee - This is just coffee from cafes. 90% of the time I drink coffee at the accommodation.

Food - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health - Travel Health Insurance, Dentist/Doctor Visits, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc - This includes paying for bathrooms (ugh), Fees/Citations, and anything that doesn't fit in the other categories.

Mobile Phone - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States. These are just SIM Cards. I do not buy a SIM card in each country. Moldova had the cheapest SIM at $1.19 for 100 GB of data.

Souvenir - I try to buy a magnet in each country (I have forgotten to buy it for 5 of the nations)

Transportation(local) - Taxis/Uber/Local Bus/Trams/Marshrutkas, etc.

Travel - Anything that takes us from one city or country to another. Ex. Bus from Slovakia to Croatia, Flight from Rhodes to Cyprus. 

Our round-trip flights from the USA to Europe and the USA to Asia were paid with airline miles :)

\*Total Ended up being $24,866.12 over 571 days or $43.55\*

195s9kc,The Amazon River: 10 facts that I have learned the hard way.,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/195s9kc/the_amazon_river_10_facts_that_i_have_learned_the/,1545,"Hello, my name is Misha. Last summer I returned from a 67-day boat trip down the Amazon River. I returned by a sheer miracle. Here is the backstory:

&gt;I had a dream to travel around the world. So I roamed and hitchhiked until the roads disappeared and there was a jungle and a river in front of me... What did I think? I thought that I should build a canoe and row down the river, of course. The idea turned out to be hilarious, even if it almost cost me my life ‚Äì pirates, you know. Let me tell you about some of my adventures through this list of interesting facts.

https://preview.redd.it/adcjpawfd8cc1.jpg?width=4206&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c04233791e901fa7bc002ac31b57e5ae80817a8c

# Fact 1. The local tastes are very unconventional.

What do you think of the dish in this photo? I'll leave this to your judgment. They also boil a kind of banana here, and the result is something similar to potatoes. When fried, they taste like potato chips.

[Whaaat? Yes.](https://preview.redd.it/7diuy39id8cc1.jpg?width=4624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30dd423239d678356663a32e85ef89868e22cefc)

# Fact 2. The locals are scared of bearded people.

No kidding! If you are planning to land in the Peruvian parts of the Amazon river, you'd better shave. It turns out that the local population has next to no hair on their arms and legs, and the same goes without saying about a beard or whiskers. As a result, many locals will be weirded out by foreigners with 'pelo cara' (Spanish for facial hair) - it's too ridiculous.

[I am](https://preview.redd.it/jc01outpd8cc1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66d9f1263f2836d7a8f3438a402898f78406fdf9)

# Fact 3. You should beat on the water surface before you go swimming.

I saw locals bathe in their boats ‚Äì pouring a bucket of water on themselves. I had thought initially that the rationale behind that was piranhas or crocodiles, but it was way more interesting: the river is full of electric eels. Those who wish to take a bath before bedtime first should hit the water with a stick a few times so that the eels are scared away. The electric shock you could receive is not fatal, but losing your consciousness while bathing can be.

[Yes, it's an anaconda](https://preview.redd.it/e232d58xd8cc1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7954e80645bbd2786ece761efb9ce7c6b3573da0)

# Fact 4. Mosquitoes that carry malaria are active at night.

There is quite a list of diseases you could catch on this river, but the most widely spread diseases are dengue fever and malaria. They say that the first one makes you crave a suicide because of the intense pain, and the second one has a number of unpleasant symptoms that do not mix well with a pleasant journey. The good thing is that the mosquito species that carries malaria is only active after sunset. I will never forget this rule: you should be under your mosquito net by 18.05. Unfortunately, it's next to impossible to escape any bites whatsoever.

https://preview.redd.it/i27sd01yd8cc1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fedfa7154f544f1463ab24759b2c8c69d2d80e2f

# Fact 5. There are dolphins in the Amazon river.

Oh, this is a miracle indeed. Pink-coloured freshwater dolphins are one of the few creatures that have no intention to off you here. This gorgeous endemic species (that is, a species that dwells in this area only) can be good company and moral support. At times they can also refreshingly startle you on a sleepy morning ‚Äì jumping out of the water right in front of the canoe. They reach 2.5 meters in length, while my canoe was only 3.5 meters long.

[It's hard to take a photo, the only photo is not mine.](https://preview.redd.it/pz6edh72e8cc1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee7014122a7ca97fe692d8c99ce88ce629f5a46)

# Fact 6. There are no crocodiles in the Amazon river.

Yes, you can relax. That‚Äôs a stereotype. There are no crocodiles there as the river is too big and the current is too strong. Who would choose to fight it all the time? So crocodiles abound in the nearby lakes instead. They range from ‚Äòregular‚Äô crocodiles to black caimans that can be rather aggressive. However, I have not heard of any single case when they attacked humans. On the contrary, the locals hunt crocodiles. One night I managed to find a crocodile to have a look at but I did not dare to kill it ‚Äì I am really fond of these gorgeous reptiles. 

https://preview.redd.it/4u6sr1pbe8cc1.jpg?width=2604&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de4acf206efd8a650ed461535b1c98644e03eb9

# Fact 7. The water itself can be dangerous. 

In alcohol there is truth, in water there are bacteria. Let‚Äôs disregard the fact that the bushes near the water can be a dwelling of snails that carry blood flukes responsible for human intestinal schistosomiasis. There is a less obvious risk. The air temperature is around 30**¬∞**C (or 86**¬∞**F), you spend ten hours a day on the open water, your canoe has a leak‚Ä¶ That means that your feet are wet all the time, and you have no problem with that during the first week. Then all this dampness leads to the ‚Äòtrench foot syndrome‚Äô. The locals say: ‚Äòaqua come piernes‚Äô, which is Spanish for ‚Äòwater eats feet‚Äô. It is fortunate that some motor oil saves the day. You apply motor oil for two or three days, and the skin on your feet has time to heal. 

https://preview.redd.it/gum0jf3fe8cc1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8fc19af8107c6d810f20635326b6352c96c79e3

# Fact 8. The locals have a grudge against the US because of ‚Äòthe UFOs‚Äô

Do you remember the superstition about beards? That was nothing. Far too many times I heard stories that the USA uses UFOs to kidnap people and experiment on them. I guess the jungle has a rich soil for everything to grow out of proportion, and folklore is not an exception. Nevertheless, the local people are incredible. Their trust and responsiveness have melted my heart. 

[My canoe \\""Liberty\\""](https://preview.redd.it/o0i8gq6qe8cc1.jpg?width=3120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93e37efb867d784ad96f7078a306a43f2cba72b2)

# Fact 9. Some local communities already have Starlink.

That is especially true for the Brazilian part of the river. The devices are powered by solar batteries (I saw solar batteries in schools in the Peruvian part as well). There is dense jungle all around, but that does not prevent people from keeping track of the current events in the world. They are especially keen on soccer. This is way more than just a game in South America. 

[There is a plate on the roof of a police pickup truck in Brazil.  Thank you, Elon!](https://preview.redd.it/679dezqte8cc1.jpg?width=4624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3400207866b943a80f352ef70815f78bfe47d884)

# Fact 10. Pirates are searching for gold and drugs.

The trust and hospitality that I saw here are shadowed by the cruelty and lawlessness right next door. Everything takes a monstrous size on the Amazon river. Everything is extreme. I will remember a segment of my way where there were no major settlements, just a few small communities hidden in the jungle. This is the very place where local pirates killed several adventurers. This was the very place where I was attacked, having almost passed it unscathed. It was the first attack of the four I survived. 

Gold is panned from this river (a photo of a gold-panning vessel is below), and it is also a route for drug traffic from Peru. These are the two things that Amazonian pirates seek to find most, while the poorer of them are ready to take even small things from you. I got robbed of everything, including a small rusty hammer. I won‚Äôt forgive that. Luckily, I still have my life.

https://preview.redd.it/cg4894yxe8cc1.jpg?width=4624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b7ae26404cbcee69e4f64b5a97e9acd8d232253

This list is just the tip of an iceberg. Would you like to learn more? Please tell me what you would like to know in the comments. If this is of any interest, I will continue the series of stories about my trip to the Amazon river. I don't speak English very well, but I will use a translator.

In airports or stations we become a huge inconvenience for everyone around us, because we occupy a huge space, making hard for everyone to circulate around the platforms.

1c46bxa,Got Scammed at Taksim Istanbul. Tourists beware.,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c46bxa/got_scammed_at_taksim_istanbul_tourists_beware/,1509,"Yesterday, while my brother and I was walking down Taksim looking for Nargile, a person bumped into us, like it was an accident. Then became friendly asking where are we going, where we are from, etc.

Then he said he's German Turkish, from Stuttgart but hometown in Antalya. His name was Mustafa.

He then said he wanted to party, go to this Tokyo Club, and he said he was going there, and we went on a cab, which he paid for.

Once we reached there, we went in and sat down, then they sent bottled water, etc. and champagne. We didn't order for it, but they popped it. My brother and I refused to drink it. Then we decided to leave, coz it was shabby, but they told us to pay 14,000 TL with 20% service charge or so. There were like 4 big and muscular bouncers intimidating us. And the funny thing is, the Mustafa guy was no longer in sight.

My brother and I feared for our lives and we signed our card to it and we're going to try to reverse the charges, wish us luck.

As we left the place, we were shivering, scared and almost shat our pants.

Guess what happened today? Down the street of Taksim at around 10-11pm, we encountered the same thing twice with 2 different people bumping into us trying to be friendly and saying they're looking to party. We then only realized Mustafa was a scam job, and we decided to ignore these 2 ppl on different occasions. We learned it the hard way, the scary and expensive way.

Other tourists, please beware. Do not take these ppl's friendliness for granted. Use common sense, and it's never too safe to put your guards up. Don't be a stupid tourist like us.",501,2024-04-14 17:35:03,NinjaWK,0.89
1fwo3rv,Croatia Road Trip 2024,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fwo3rv,1500,"This summer I went on a trip to Croatia with my family. We rented a car and went from Zagreb all the way to Dubrovnik. Here‚Äôs a summary.

Zagreb -&gt; Istria  -&gt; Plitvice -&gt; -Dalmatian Coast -(ferry)-&gt; Hvar -(ferry)-&gt; Dubrovnik

Here are some thoughts and things I wish I knew before visitng :)

- The coast is VERY expensive, Western Europe prices or even higher. A pizza was nearly double the price compared to Istria. 

- The weather was very hot during the day, so walking around towns in the evening became our favorite activity. Dusk in Trogir was absolutely magical

- Truffle hunting was our favorite activity. Our guide and 3 cute dogs found over 10 truffles, then made us the best meal of our trip. Autumn is white truffle season which I didn‚Äôt know

- Plitvice is just as blue as the photos. Lower lakes for blue waters and upper lakes for waterfalls.

- Tolls are fairly simple, grab a ticket when you pass the gate, and pay for it when you get off the highway, cards are always accepted

- Jadroninija became uncomfortably hot after just 1 hour on the way to Hvar, but TP Line was amazing with AC and a minibar. I highly recommend.

- There‚Äôs a plethora of supermarkets in Croatia, for us Plodine came out as the cheapest, and no, we didn‚Äôt get food poisoning once

- Motovun was our favorite town in vibes, but we made the mistake of towing our suitcases up 300 meters of slope, just for reception to tell us there was a free transfer service. Take note of this if you plan to stay there

Overall we had a wonderful time, definitely a must visit!

I've noticed so many vloggers and met plenty of people myself who talk about their 'authentic experiences' when really they're just comparing themselves to those less fortunate. 

An example being a couple I met in Laos who told me about their trekking in Nong Khiaw and their exact words were ""they had no running water or electricity, it just felt so authentic"". So, does that mean the people living in Luang Prabang or Vientiane are somehow less Lao in your eyes?

Similarly, the same people tend to be very high and mighty about not visiting tourist attractions as if it is beneath them somehow. Like don't get me wrong, we all hate being overcharged or being stuck in large crowds but why try to invalidate someone else's trip?

So I've been curious about the situation there and would rather get to talk to people on the ground and learn.

I ended up finding a route through Moldova through buses to travel into Odessa which takes about 4 hours from RMO airport.

Life goes on but there were some scary moments as the air raid sirens went off 3 different times with one drone getting knocked out.

Other interesting things:
*Martial Law at midnight 
*People somewhat listen for the air raid sirens but there are telegram channels
*Outside of some brownouts, people are living just like normal
*You can see some damage
*Odessa doesn't have the same anti-aircraft as Kyiv but Kyiv is an almost 18 hour bus ride from Poland
*No problems using touch pay or credit cards at all
*No men 18-55 on the bus in/out
*The beach is nice to chill and the heatwave is serious here

1bcyeu4,Living in poverty in Vietnam,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bcyeu4/living_in_poverty_in_vietnam/,1459,"This won't be your usual question post. This is about being submerged in a culture.

I've travelled around a few countries, especially south east asia. You get a flavour, but I sought something I'd never experienced. So I signed myself up to work for a charity in rural Vietnam.

I'm living with a poor family on a pig farm, teaching English to the less fortunate of the less fortunate. Having worked on a farm before, having been a vegetarian for over a decade (and stopped), and having spent a few months in Vietnam before, I'm still full of new changes. I love this country, mainly for the people. They are welcoming, generous, and rich in so many areas other than wealth. So I'll put some sections in to skip to.

Rules of the road: I knew this before, but it still is crazy how it strikes me. Like a lot of Asia, it's big fish/little fish. The bigger the vehicle, the higher the priority. HGVs won't stop at junctions, you stop. I ride a bike everywhere, as do most people. You ride on the right hand side (or the very far left if you want, for short journeys). Honking is a standard, the more you honk, the less willing you are to stop, it just means ""I'm here! Watch out!"", and deeper toned horns are for the bigger vehicles. Turn into your junction early, be confident in your decision. 

Food: I didn't go into this position to judge. I've turned down the dog meat, but almost everything else is fair game. I stopped asking what something is unless I intend to not eat it again. It only dawned on me the other day that I eat little pork when living on a pig farm. Then I realised, all the good pig meat is sold, I eat what isn't generally sold; the joints, intestines (amongst other internal organs), skin, blood, gristle, cartilage, boiled fat etc... I've become much better at eating what I couldn't before (waste not/want not). Everything we eat is from within a few hundred metres; from fruit and veg to the fish from the pond out back.

The farm: I doubt many of you have witnessed the sound of feeding pigs in cages. The sound is that of slaughter, twice a day. Having raised many dogs, I try not to think of the ones in tiny cages that never leave, and must freeze at night in the winter. They look so scared, and happy for a brief encounter to be fed slop. The skinny chickens are the most free animals, and fruit is picked from trees daily. We wake up at 05:00, they eat breakfast at 05:30, lunch at 11:15, dinner at 18:15.

My surroundings: we're now in spring, mosquitoes swarm like I've never seen. I'm glad the smell of damp and  mold is lifting as the seasons change. The farm also sells beer and moonshine; both are pretty good tbh. The family comprises of the drandfather, grandmother, their son and daughter, 3 children, and then next door is their brothers and sisters and their children, totalling to about 16 - 19 (I'm still unsure). I haven't seen soap used for anything; plates and cups/glasses are rinsed with the undrinkable tap water.

People: People don't talk, it's closer to shouting (but they're not angry). They're proud of who they are, and aware of how little they have. Where money lacks, it seems communtiy has to be stronger. They want you to have a full belly. They'll talk to you knowing you don't understand (I only wish translation apps were better for the task). In the past I've met people on mountain sides who would beckon me in to stay the night, just becomes that's in their nature. They're very grateful I'm here to teach English in a country who's tourism makes up so much of the economy, and constantly want to show their respects however they can.

Costs: draft beer where I am is roughly $0.25 a glass. Lunch will cost you about a dollar. Accommodation will cost somewhere around $2+/night. Pack of smokes $0.5, lighter 8cents. A full tank of gas for the bike is about $3.25. Go to a clothes store, you can buy a full outfit for $12 that will read gucci on the outside and addidas on the tag, it's kinda hilarious. 

Kids: I have to throw this section in, the kids are wonderfully adorable all round! Each one is a bundle of joy! They run to great you with high fives, hugs, and using the only english they know. I restrain for using my western upbringing on how they're treated; as servants, as workers, as an amusement sometimes to hit with thin bamboo (sometimes inciting it on other children). I don't know how common it is, but where I am, it sure is. I was told it's disciplinary, and when I remarked how unheard of that is where I'm from, they saw my country as lawless. I keep a bit tongue at times. The children may walk around freely amongst busy roads, yet with an innate sense of avoiding danger.

As a teacher, I could make more in a week than a local can in a month. I've already had someone suggest their daughter to me. It's really uncommon to be my age, unmarried, and not have something wrong with me. I don't know what to make of all these events, but it's definitely an experience I haven't had travelling before. I haven't had a verbal conversation with someone who isn't  a teacher in ages. I saw a white person the other week and stared at them in shock the same way locals stare at me.

Anyway, thought I'd share my travel experiences with you all. Vietnam is a wonderous country in many ways, please visit!

I feel people, this sub included, are really crazy for Japan to the point that if you say anything relatively negative about it you get 'downvoted.' I know Japan has been on the bucket list for many people, growing up with anime, sushi, videogames, manga, etc I didn't know one friend who didn't want to go to Japan. But after having visited, I don't see how this was a ""spiritual experience"" ""changed my life"" or ""best country I've ever visited"" kind of thing, and I wonder if it's because people are already so attached since children to Japan?

I was there for work recently, and only had time to visit Kyoto and Tokyo, I thought it was nice, but I didn't love it. It was just like any other place to me. I found CDMX to be more interesting, Kyoto was really touristy and perhaps maybe I shouldn't have gone there when I did. I was looking up more places to visit but none caught my attention. Nature wise, I think there are prettier countries like NZ, Canada, US, Chile. The food was good, but was disappointed in so many dishes.

Yes, of course I want to go back, but I think I China would be on my top list, even Indonesia or Vietnam. ",1003,2024-08-18 06:42:09,Pale_Field4584,0.88

1efw83q,"Assisi, Italy is so amazing! (December 2023)",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1efw83q,1433,"Last December, I took a day trip from Rome to Assisi. It was not an easy day trip - firstly, I had to take the fairly sparse direct train which took around 2 hours. The train stopped at the lower part of Assisi, so I needed to then take a 15-minute bus to the hilltop town. I left this town at night on the same day.

I still keep thinking about this place seven months after my visit. It‚Äôs so amazing!

I was short on time and hence did it as a day trip. It‚Äôs amazing and I do not regret the time spent on public transport at all. There were many people (more pilgrims for Assisi than tourists based on my observation though), but the town still felt peaceful and gave off a very spiritual vibe - partly because of its religious background, but also because of the great natural setting (Umbrian countryside). The weather was great. The absolutely gorgeous Christmas lights and parade also added to the magic.

For those who are thinking of having a Christmas trip to Italy this year, I definitely recommend it since Rome, Florence etc. are all beautiful with the Christmas decoration. I would also recommend Assisi which isn‚Äôt the most popular place in Italy, and perhaps staying there for one or two nights to get to know the place better than I did :)

**You like to have access to both beautiful nature and big cities ?** Taiwan has the gorges, forests, national parks, hills covered in tea plants, but also modern neighbourhoods like Ximending, towers like Taipei 101, art center like in Kaohsiung, hotels on tops of malls like in Taichung.

**You like cloudy mountain hikes ?** Taiwan has the whole Alishan region.

**You like being by the sea ?** Taiwan is an island with smaller islands and while going to the beach is not the number 1 activity, you can definitely have a good swim in some cities or in places like Orchid Island.

**You like cheap food but prefer if the hygiene is also good ?** Taiwan has an amazing foodie culture for all budgets, with lots of street food ""night markets"" but extremely low risk for food poisoning due to excellent hygiene and fresh produce. And they have all the convenience stores.

**You want a place that's not super touristy but where locals still speak enough English that you can get by ?** Taiwan has many touristic attractions but very few draw big crowds (the Japanese and Koreans go to Jiufen in mass because of the Ghibli vibes but that's it), yet almost everyone I met spoke at least a few words of English, the younger generation generally spoke decently and many people are happy to chat with you using Google translate. I speak Mandarin Chinese which did help, but my mom who speaks no Chinese could still get by.

**You like to drive and be free ?** It's super easy to rent a scooter and generally safe to drive around if you can drive in the occasional rain.

**You prefer to use public transportation?** Taiwan has an excellent and modern network of metros, buses and trains, that all have AC and usually WiFi, for a very cheap price (3-5‚Ç¨ for trains between cities) and you can use the same transportation card all over the country for everything except trains (plus you can use it to pay in convenience stores).

**You want to feel safe as a solo traveler or as a woman, you don't want to deal with potential scams ?** Taiwan is extremely safe at day and night and outside of barely overcharging you for a trinket, you never have to be scared of anyone trying to just take your money.

**You want to see unique temples with their own traditions ?** Just the city of Tainan has over 12,000 temples, and the island of Taiwan overall embraces syncretism with a mix of Buddhism, Taoism and local folk religion, with the worship of the sea goddess Mazu especially but also of many martial gods. Religious diversity is so normal that you will find Muslim prayer rooms in most train stations, big museums, and big tourists attractions.

**You're really sensitive to heat + humidity and are scared of any earthquake?** Okay maybe Taiwan isn't for you haha

Anyway, just saying, our trip to Taiwan was phenomenal ! We spend a good 2 weeks and it was great, my first time was 3 weeks, and I think I'd recommend spending 10 days to a 4 weeks if you want to explore the whole country and 5 days if you're focusing on the capital Taipei with day trips from there.",327,2024-08-23 08:07:10,smolbibeans,0.96

After a few years of persistence however, I was finally convinced by my wife to do an all inclusive. I have in because the last few trips we‚Äôve done have been *very* exhausting and heavy on planning and activities. It‚Äôs also cold and frigid here in Canada right now so I thought it might be nice to get away from that a little bit.

So we ended up doing a week-long all-inclusive resort stay at a really nice hotel in Mexico, Puerto Vallarta to be exact. And honestly? I actually really loved it to the point where I consider one of the best trips I‚Äôve taken in years - and this includes some incredible destinations like Japan, Norway and Argentina. 

The caveats of course, are that there really isn‚Äôt any ‚Äútravel‚Äù related experiences here. There‚Äôs no immersing yourself in a new culture or local experiences or anything like that. It‚Äôs a pretty closed off and hermetic experience - we were pretty much within the resort walls the entire time. 

But in terms of it being a *vacation* - it was truly incredible. You don‚Äôt have to worry about a thing. All we did was wake up, relax by the pool or the ocean, eat whenever we got hungry, have copious amounts of alcohol, laze in the hotel room watching trash tv if that‚Äôs what we felt like, and in general just relax. We did some activities, like kayaking and snorkeling, and that was great too. 

And that‚Äôs where I really see the appeal of these types of vacations - it was truly *relaxing* unlike any other trip I‚Äôve done before. It was lovely for once to not have an itinerary to follow or sights to see or a train to catch or whatever. Time passed slow and we just kinda did whatever we felt like. It was fantastic to sit by the beautiful blue ocean waters, read a book and sip on a mojito.

tl;dr



I phoned into a radio station and I was one of the first callers, so I won a free trip of my choice to either Jamaica, Mexico, or Puerto Rico. I was so excited! However, the radio station wanted $99 to seal the deal and then required me to visit a timeshare presentation two hours away from where I lived. It turns out, the trip was actually not free and throughout the course of setting this trip up, they required more and more money until I had given them just as much money as I would have spent had I booked it on my own. $833.50 market price. For this free trip we ended up paying $836 and gave 12 hours of our time. If you see this post, please for your sake, DO NOT TAKE THE TRIP! DO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY! RUN! Below is the full account of my story.



‚Äî---------

My boyfriend and I love listening to the 99JAMZ Miami radio station. One day, we phoned them in order to win the free trip to either Jamaica, Mexico, or Puerto Rico. When we had gotten the call that we won, we were immediately unsure. The reason being, is that they had requested $99 and if something is free, why are you having to pay $99??? They said it would be non-refundable and this would be to take care of the radio station. Then you will have to find a way to get to the timeshare presentation that, for us, was only 2 hours away, because we drove from Florida Keys where we lived all the way to Fort Lauderdale. We had 24 hours to decide. Panic, panic. Fine! We‚Äôll do it! As grueling as that presentation could be, we‚Äôll have our free trip after this, right?



Sure enough, the presentation was grueling. We spent a total of 6 hours (4 hr commute round trip and 2 presentation) and $60 on gas. They do their best in the meeting to get you to purchase travel packages and many people actually do. These are pro experienced salesmen. It‚Äôs hard to say no and they guilt-trip you if you choose not to listen! There were other folks who may have not been as fortunate to live so close, so they had come a really long way for this presentation. Think about the gas money! Possible flight!



Once we‚Äôre done with the presentation, we learn of the company that 99JAMZ is partnered with. They are called GRCVO. And from here on out, we will be dealing with GRCVO. They want a $199 non-refundable deposit that will go towards our ‚Äúfree‚Äù trip and this will cover some of the extra fees that we will pay for this trip such as international taxes, fees, etc. We decided to give them the money because we had already put so much time and money into this whole thing. We knew that we were in too deep to go back. Now, GRCVO is very discreet. And if you want to speak with them, make sure you are prepared to wait more than an hour on hold each time you call them!



We called GRCVO to choose a travel date, a location, and from their short list of hotels. We chose Montego Bay. We could pick from 3 hotels in Montego Bay and depending on the price of the hotel, that would determine how much money we would have to pay. They give you rapid fire information over the phone and you have to tell them to slow down. For the hotel we selected, they wanted $478 to cover the rest of the trip fees. ‚ÄúWhat fees‚Äù? I asked them. ‚ÄúAgency fees, hotel fees, international taxes, etc‚Äù. Absurd! Know that they will not answer any important questions like how much luggage can you bring on the plane? Can you request a King bed on my reservation? Can I have an itemized receipt of all the different fees? Will you have a shuttle to pick us up from airport? The answer is always ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do that‚Äù and you have to call the hotel and you have to call the airline and you have you have to do everything yourself. And this is 100% non-refundable.



Here is what our options were and what these things would have cost had we booked it on our own.



MARKET PRICE

Flight for 2 people, Basic Economy: $593.50

Hotel that we chose, total price: $240

**TOTAL MARKET PRICE : $833.50**



WHAT WE ACTUALLY PAID: $99 + $199 + $478 = $776

Gas to drive to/from timeshare: $60 + 6 hours of our time

Throughout my whole experience calling them: 6 total hours on hold

**TOTAL PRICE WE PAID: $836 + 12 hours of my time**



Book the trip on you own. There were absolutely no perks of booking with these people, only more headache and worry. Everything is non-refundable. Blah blah blah.

I have seen a bunch of comments and videos on Instagram and Tiktok since the Alaska Airlines incident along the lines of: ""I will never fly on a 737 MAX again"", ""I'm never flying Boeing again"", etc. With replies of people sharing the same sentiment.

Like my title asks, is this even possible?

You say you're never flying on that plane again, but then what? Are you going to pay potentially WAY more money for a different ticket on a different flight just to avoid flying on that plane?

I'm curious about this because I have a flight to Mexico in the spring with Aeromexico on a 737 MAX 8. It was not cheap by any means but was also on the lower end of the pricing spectrum when compared to other Mexico tickets.

So I ask because for me, pricing is a HUGE factor when it comes to choosing plane tickets, and I'm sure it is for a lot of other people out there.

Being able to choose specifically what plane to fly or not fly on seems like a luxury not everyone can afford.

Also, I know the 737 is one of the most popular planes in the skies, so it would be extremely hard to avoid it if you are a frequent traveller no?

I flew to Toronto and LA this passed summer too for work, I went back to look at those bookings and sure enough, they were on 737 MAX 8s as well.",1006,2024-01-07 16:22:05,FirstV1,0.9

1bf8rri,International boarding fiasco w/ minors,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bf8rri/international_boarding_fiasco_w_minors/,1298,"I'm in the Dublin airport with my son. The group I'm about to describe is American, and it doesn't matter but so are we.

We are early and the flight ahead of us was just closing the gates. A group led by two men with about 10 kids age 12-17 run up. The agents tell them sorry, we just closed, but they persist and the gate agents relent, seeing all the kids. As they are scanning passports, two more kids run up. The agents are surprised, as are the two men leading the group. 

It's chaos, but it all seems ok. The men in charge are already scanned in as the two stragglers get scanned. One group leader says to the other 'do we have them all? ... I don't think I've seen my kid.'

...

The gate agents are alarmed (as is the crowd waiting for the next flight, watching on), and the agent says 'who are you missing?' Neither guy knows, exactly. They are sure of at least one, one of their own children, maybe one more?

My eyes begin to pop out of my head. The guy with the missing kid goes 'can you tell us who we're missing?' To the gate agent. The agent has to literally sift through the manifest for minors. They check a few things and it turns out they are missing not one or two, but eight kids. EIGHT. 

One kid arrives during this, looking bewildered and frazzled. He's all alone. The guys 'help' by shouting at the kid to hustle and board. 
 
7 missing kids in an international airport. These men in charge of the kids have no clue what they are doing, and seem to think that it should be someone else's job to get these kids safely to the gate. I'm losing my mind just watching this unfold. 

The chaperone men stand around right next to the gate agents, not even at a helpful location where they can bring kids in with a better line of sight, doing absolutely nothing. Some chatter emerges that suggests this is a connection flight. 

The agents are squirming, hard, presumably realizing they made a big mistake letting this group partially board. 

Two kids show up, also frazzled and stressed. These dudes yell at this pair just like the last kid to hustle and board. 

5 still missing. At this point, the plane has been held up a long time past when the gates were already closed. The gate agents have to tell the men that one needs to go onboard with the group of children. Off goes one of the dudes. 

More minutes pass. Names called over the loud speaker. No kids.

The gate agents ask the dude if he'll board, or stay behind if all don't show in the next 2 minutes because they need to pull his bag if he's not continuing. The guy didn't know. He didn't know. 5 teenagers in his care, lost in an international airport, and he wasn't sure if he should stay behind. 

These gate agents realized they had to steer him, or perhaps realized asking the question was the real mistake. He was going to have to stay. 

Three teenagers start running to a gate two gates down. The dude tries to stop the kids and direct them onto his flight. They were not his kids. The runners had to shake him off and continue onto their flight. This horrible human didn't even know which kids were in his care. OMG 

The crowd watching this loses it at this point. My own son has to vocalize that he cannot believe how unprepared and ignorant this man is, and he's feeling incredibly upset for all the kids involved. 

More agonizing minutes go by. One bewildered teenage boy runs up, gets checked in. Another 90 seconds pass. A boy and a girl arrive, breathless, and board.

The two remaining names are called on repeat. 

A total of 30 minutes have passed since the first time the gate closed. This horrible human continues to stand idly, not even scanning the crowd. He's told that they have to release the plane. 

The last two blow in just as they are closing the gates a final time. They reopen and all three board. 

I'm horrified, super stressed, and need a drink and it's 6am. 

If you want to let your children travel with chaperones in a school group, think long and hard before signing up. I could have never have imagined a more cavalier, useless, or negligent ""chaperone"" team before this mornings experience. Those poor kids. 

Update: I assumed the trip was organized by a school. I didn't know for sure. Perhaps it was a church group or a private school. 

I want to also put in a strong endorsement for travel for children. However, with all things, use caution. I've traveled internationally as a child with a school group and it was spectacular and organized. It helped shape me and opened my eyes to a bigger world. I have long wanted the same for my kids but the opportunity hasn't come along yet, although domestic travel has come along and it's been great for them. Plans were laid out before hand, the chaperones were known, everyone went and came home safe and sound with only happy memories.

That said, my closing remarks in my post urge caution. I would not endorse sending your children for travel of any kind with people ill suited to the task, disorganized, unfamiliar with your child, and/or disinterested in being a chaperone.

THREE Updates at bottom for those waking up to this post

.

We flew to Mexico from ATL last weekend. I was checking us in for our flight tomorrow morning and my husband mentions to me that he didn‚Äôt think to bring his green card and he hopes he doesn‚Äôt need it.

When we‚Äôve flown together previously, he had the visa stamp in his MX passport. This is our first time flying together when he has a physical green card. Yes, I‚Äôm absolutely furious because it was such a dumb mistake on his part and I‚Äôm trying to not feel guilty about *NOT(edited) asking him about it before but now I just want to figure this out.

Is there ANY way he can get into the states tomorrow? He has his MX passport, MX ID and USA drivers license. His green card is not expired but it‚Äôs at our home in the USA.

Otherwise it looks like we need to apply for a ‚Äúboarding foil‚Äù (but that looks like it‚Äôs mostly for lost or stolen cards?) or physically mail him his green card?

Which is a faster option? 

Ugh, this just sucks so majorly. I don‚Äôt know how he can be such a dumbass.

Thanks

.

.

UPDATE ONE, three hours before check in:

So the comments and advice seem to say we have three options:

1. Enter by land
2. Apply for a boarding foil
3. Mail his green card to MX

Entering by land seems sketchy and logistically messy.

Applying for the boarding foil involves the US embassy. I had looked at their website before and therefore knew our two best options were mailing his green card or applying for a foil. The after hours  emergency contact line actually won‚Äôt accept any attempts at contact from me for this issue. It just sends me to the page about applying for the boarding foil.

So. For the boarding foil. Per the embassy‚Äôs website, they won‚Äôt even give us an appointment until we do three things: 

1. attempt to contact the port of entry for permission. Unfortunately, they do not have a 24/7 line. I won‚Äôt be able to call ATL until around the time we‚Äôll be getting at the airport here in CDMX. Don‚Äôt worry, I do plan to call at that time.

2. Literally beg the airline. Well, specifically have them contact the Carrier Liaison program. Thanks to the redditor who first mentioned that. It‚Äôs to request an exception be made to board without a green card. So yes, that is a legitimate option but up to the airline‚Äôs discretion.

If those options fail, then we need to‚Ä¶

3. Apply for the boarding foil by filling out the form, paying the $575 fee to file the form, and request an appointment to file the form. And then it takes two days before it prints.



So, TLDR, we will be contacting port of entry when they open, have the airline call the Regional Carrier Liaison Program when we go to check in (per the requirements of the embassy), and if those options don‚Äôt work, forgo the boarding foil in favor of mailing the green card overnight via DHL since it should get there before my husband will even be able to get an appointment at the embassy. But certainly the boarding foil is our backup plan.

.

.

UPDATE TWO

As usual, everything the internet tells you, whether by a Redditor or embassy website, is wrong.

Delta moved our whole family to a later flight to give them time to call immigration to get permission for him to fly. It might work, it might not, they DO want a photo of his green card, so I‚Äôm glad my mom sent that to us and we printed it out. So thanks to the supervisor dude for doing that super fast. Our connecting flight in ATL had an insane layover anyway, so IF immigration says to send him over, we‚Äôll still hopefully have four hours for them to hold him for as long as they need to to verify his permanent residency. We‚Äôll likely have to pay a fine.

Our plan B is still having his green card overnighted. I‚Äôll update when we find out if he can board in a couple hours but at least for now we‚Äôre together and Delta is helping us out.

Also, sorry I suck at formatting on mobile. Hope the sections are clear.

Husband says that yes, he is an idiot. But he doesn‚Äôt have a Mexican girlfriend he‚Äôs trying to stay with. 

.

.

UPDATE THREE

Delta issued my husband a boarding pass. The understanding is that this is a ‚Äúone time thing‚Äù and we will ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù pay a $500 fee once we get to ATL. As that is less than the $575 fee to be issued a boarding foil, I‚Äôll call that a win if we end up needing to pay it. (Correction, the fee/fine are about the same! So no financial win if we end up needing to pay, but at this point I‚Äôm not going to split hairs!) I‚Äôm expecting we‚Äôll probably be pulled at customs for extra scrutiny, but we had an abnormally long layover in ATL anyway, so we‚Äôll be fine as we have four hours to get to our final flight. They did want a photo of his green card. I guess it was to compare to the photo on his passport. Extra thanks to my mom who has been supporting us every step of the way despite it being super early in the morning and who was able to supply us with those pictures. She went to our house at midnight to get the GC, and was up again this morning to take extra photos for the check in people.

I guess I‚Äôll update one more time once we clear customs state side. ü§ûüèº

.

.

.

FINAL UPDATE

So good news! We landed in ATL, and everything was surprisingly‚Ä¶ empty. We basically walked up to the security desk and told the guy our situation. He said, ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not good‚Äù and we said, we know. Forms to file, fees to pay, and he goes, ‚Äúoh good, so you‚Äôve done your homework.‚Äù When he asks what happened, why we didn‚Äôt have the GC, I said ‚Äúbecause my husband is a dumbass‚Äù and the agent said, ‚Äúwell I can‚Äôt put that in my system, so let‚Äôs go with it was an accident.‚Äù Then he walked us back to the office, and we never made it past the waiting room. The next dude took my husband‚Äôs passport, checked it out, said, ‚Äúyeah, don‚Äôt do that again or you‚Äôll have to pay a $585 fee. It happens, people forget their documents. I know you‚Äôll remember yours next time. You‚Äôre free to go.‚Äù And that was it. It took us 10 seconds in the back office. Suspiciously easy, but we‚Äôll take it.

Wooooo!!!!!!

Thanks delta, my mom,  and the super understanding border officers.

We‚Äôre in Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant getting burgers.

So no, we aren‚Äôt fucked. And my husband won‚Äôt ever make that mistake again. The key for us was to be knowledgeable, flexible, and kind and we received the same treatment back.

Safe traveling, everyone. We‚Äôre going home.

the things I thought would be issues were not at all. The flights were easy ( the FA allowed us to use the blow up foot stools and we slept ) . The kids were never bored and loved the food . The minimal luggage could have been even further reduced as we wore the same things and used the washers at the airbnbs . Not a single drop of rain. Time change wasn‚Äôt a problem . No issues with pick pockets or ever feeling unsafe . 

The things we didn‚Äôt consider : restaurants closing midday until after 7/8 pm. Getting incredibly sick  and navigating the medication regulation, lack of air circulation in the airbnbs and no remotes to cool the rooms, the mosquitos that would come in through open windows, and the 5 yo becoming trapped in a bathroom for an hour in Florence due to the lock failing . The shock from waiters when we‚Äôd ask for butter noodles for the 5 yo .  Just a natural learning curve with traveling and nothing was really an issue .

The sites were nice , desserts were amazing, public transport okayish but I wanted to bring up an incident related to a restaurant.

We went to a restaurant around 7PM, we were there solely for desserts but since we were tired we ordered some starters and a Champaign as well then the waiter came in and asked for the next order and we told him that we'll be ordering desserts, he got super offended that we weren't ordering any main courses and asked us if we'd told the same to the manager before we got assigned the table.... Then he went to get the manager, the manager came in and told us that it's a ""dinner"" restraunt and it's mandatory to take a main course. The smile on their faces completely disappeared and there was a visible frustration but he reluctantly let us get desserts mentioning that he'll be allowing this to happen only for this one time. The bill was already ‚Ç¨75, idk how much more he was expecting.

I hadn't experienced anything like this before, is this common? Am I wrong here for not knowing the restraunt rules in Paris. Does it happen often?",116,2024-07-03 14:43:57,Acrobatic_Oven_1108,0.96

Today I returned from the first day of the conference to find that all of my personal belongings had been emptied from the room. 

After some back and forth with various managers, it was uncovered that the housekeeper had disposed of all my belongings. She thought I had checked out since there was no suitcase or backpack in the room. I am flabbergasted that there was no manifest or something like that for housekeepers to know which rooms were checked in, or that she didn't check if there was one.

Most of my stuff was able to be pulled from the trash without any apparent harm. I am missing about ~¬£70 worth of stuff, nothing really individually valuable, just stuff that adds up (a sleep mask, several pairs of socks).

I guess I don't know why I'm posting this. Has anyone ever had anything like this happen? I want the money to make up for the missing stuff. Being completely honest, I also want to check out and be refunded for my stay so I can book a different accommodation (I'm here three more nights).

Despite traveling as a couple, most of the times, we liked to use it to have a ""taste"" of living as a local. 

Hong Kong, Paris, Copenaghen. Great experiences, back when people used to put their own homes/flats up for rent while they were abroad.

During covid we didn't travel and having a baby put a pause on our travelling.

This year we started travelling back in Asia (with our kid) and boy how shitty the whole Airbnb experience has become.

All of our visited places so far (2 in Philippines and 2 in Bangkok) have been so awful.

All places are just sub-rented places, they put a few things in, and they put it up on Airbnb. Dirty as hell, no amenities. Like we are 3 people but you find only 2 forks, 1 mug, 1 glass, etc. One of the places in Bangkok had mold. Another one had mushrooms [Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/1GVlN1Z.jpg) [Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/6H5YlND.jpg) growing from the kitchen wooden side panel... 

Rules over rules. I understand some travellers are assholes too, but come on.

It seems the Hosts have lost their common sense. 

Just now, I post this after cancelling my airbnb stay in Makati next week (we are 4 people) because of their rules and requests, and preferred to book 2 hotel rooms (which guess what, they came even cheaper than this airbnb place we got).

I was travelling to Las Vegas last week and booked with Luxor. First time there, and wanted affordable accommodation. 

I called the booking services after booking through their website to inform them my flight would arrive at 10:30 PM local time and I could check in as late as 1 AM. They happily put down a note saying late check in to avoid any random fees. Furthermore, without me asking, they asked if I had any room specifications. They said they could happily book me to a room on a higher level away from elevators. They then recommended some good spots in Vegas and told me they can make special reservations in MGM hotel restaurants. They were very nice, kind and accommodating, a big surprise to me after going with AirBnb for a couple of years.

My flight then got cancelled. Stupid Air Canada couldn‚Äôt find the staff to fly the plane. I quickly called Luxor to let them know. They immediately removed one nights stay from my booking without even me asking. They said I wouldn‚Äôt be charged for the room and they can waive the early check in fee as well. I have never seen or heard such an accommodating and helpful establishment, anywhere. When I arrived at the check in, they did as they said. No charge for the missed night and mo early check in fees. 

I already put these down in Trip Advisor but I feel the need to give them a shout here as well. Over and over I read horror stories about hotels, and I feel like this is a nice change for once.

1frdbjj,Brussels is Terrible,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1frdbjj/brussels_is_terrible/,1153,"Brussels was... underwhelming¬†

So I had heard a lot of interesting stories on Reddit about Brussels, and I was eager to explore for myself. I went on the train to the infamous Gare du Midi in Brussels.¬†

The first problem was the fact it was a sunny day, which already dampened my expectations. I waddled out of the unassuming train station looking for the expected crack junkies, but did not find any. Bummer. Maybe I should have arrived in the evening. Maybe a chance on the ride back. So I went out for a walk along a long sort of promenade with trees along the way. The amount of trash was a bit lackluster, maybe I went on the wrong day. I did spot some bags and a few planks close to the street tho, so the little things count I guess. Finally a saw two hobos asleep near a building. Finally.¬†¬†

I then visited both the comic museum and the Natural Museum of History. Its a shame the Brussels Museum of Natural History is not more well known, it has an interesting array of fossils, including the famous Iguanodons of Bernissaert.¬†

But to my horror I was not raped, stabbed, robbed, or murdered even once during my visit. Even on my way back in the evening I hardly spotted any junks. I visited three other times after that but still no luck.¬†

But in all seriousness

  
What is the deal with Brussels on reddit? I have literally seen people state that Brussels is, according to them, more unsafe than places like Chicago or Baltimore(yes, I am not kidding). The hate for Brussels on reddit is quite extreme, and I am saying that as a dutchman.

Of course, compared to the cities in my own country, Brussels has a lot more rundown buildings, more visible homelessness(you almost never see homeless people in the Netherlands, except during Covid), and is generally dirtier and more unkempt. But that holds true for Belgian cities in general, and cities like Paris and Rome also had visible dirtyness, sketchiness and homelessness. 

So I looked up some statistics, and when you take the average of the homicide rate of the last say 6 or 7 years it is around 2.3.

 That is higher than Amsterdam sure(1,85). But if you do the same for Chicago you get 25(not 2.5, but 25, which is 10 times as high a rate as Brussels) and in Baltimore its more like 46(!!).

Its not even close to being close, just the accidental victims of stray bullets would probably lead to a higher number than the Brussels homicide rate. 

  
By the way, I have visited Brussels like over 20 times, including gare du Nord and Midi. The shadiest part of that city is the red light district next to gare du Nord, but even that place is not even close to being close to being close to Middle east, Baltimore. Its just a bizarre comparison. Why the exaggeration? ",347,2024-09-28 07:36:03,Speeskees1993,0.81

What do I do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f9xmzf/greyhound_bus_departed_32_mins_early_without_me/,1146,"As title. My car broke down irreparably in Richfield Utah, which is a tiny town in the desert. It is a total loss and I am just trying to get home to Denver. The only way to do that is to catch a bus and Greyhound are the only ones who come here. There is only one bus a day and it departs from a gas station parking lot at 7:30am. Well I arrived at the departure point at 7am - 30 mins early was the guidline they gave me - only to be told that the bus had just left. The tracker shows it departed at 6:58am.

The only phone number for Greyhound is for ticketing, and even though they acknowledge I did nothing wrong and admit that their company was at fault, they aren't putting me up in a hotel or anything. All they said they could do was reschedule me for tomorrow, leaving me on the side of the road for 24hrs, and they directed me to their 'submit feedback' form on their website saying that they would help me there. I filled out the form, and explained the situation, and all I have gotten from them is an email that says, and I quote, ""Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to share your thoughts."" (I wish I was joking).

I will also note that Greyhound supposedly has a policy where you are eligible for a refund if the bus is delayed by more than 2 hrs. Well I am delayed by a full day so that should apply to me, right? Wrong. According to the guy on the phone, the bus was not delayed, so I am not eligible for anything. He just kept repeating ""there is no delay"" as I tried to explain my situation and then he hung up on me as I was trying to get him to tell me what it was I did wrong.

I paid for a hotel for another night tonight even though I can't afford it as I am unemployed and just lost my car, and hopefully the bus will show up tomorrow, but I just spoke to one of the hotel staff and she said it took her 4 days of rescheduling to get a bus to visit California. 

Anyway, do I really have no other options to get home? As far as I can tell, I don't, but maybe someone else knows something. And can I do anything with regards to Greyhound, since they are the ones who messed up? Can I at least take them to small claims court to get them to cover my hotel tonight?

Thanks and sorry for the long post.

Next day update - bus came early again, but I am on it. Full of sketchy people, and there is an old lady with no pants, but I can live with that for a few hours if it gets me home. Thanks everyone for your help and suggestions.

Another update - the lady with no pants actually does have shorts on, and that is also all she has as a prior bus abandoned her and her husband, with their bags still on it, as they were standing outside at a stop not four feet from it. I am not getting off this bus at all until it gets to Denver, and I can't help but think that anyone who does is taking a huge risk.",182,2024-09-05 16:11:59,Trevorius,0.96

1ei5jtm,USA cross country adventure,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ei5jtm,1130,"Me and my wife started planning a huge trip across the US last summer, and we finally managed to do it this April. We have always dreamed of seeing the states since we were kids. We are from Romania, and since I can remember, the US culture was extremely influential here, and we wanted to see for ourselves. And of course, we got to see the total eclipse in Arkansas.

We weren't disappointed. We had just about under four weeks of travel and sightseeing. I am fully aware that we haven't experienced even half of what there is, but the country is huge, and we are happy with what we saw. This older post pretty much sums up our itinerary [https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1bd7cb1/new\_york\_to\_los\_angeles\_road\_trip\_in\_23\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1bd7cb1/new_york_to_los_angeles_road_trip_in_23_days/)

We landed in New York, and I drove almost 8000km to Los Angeles. The experience was so amazing that I didn't start feeling tired until maybe the last three days.

My personal favorite parts were, of course, the national parks. I wish I could have spent at least a week in each one we visited. The Western parks especially are so interesting and, of course, so much more different than what we have in Europe. Shenandoah and the Smoky mountains are similar.

The people are incredibly nice and always smiling. I have to admit that I was jealous. We aren't always that happy and positive. In New York, the bartender forgot to serve my beer, and of course, I politely asked 10 minutes later. He then showed up with a free beer and some fries. Amazing.

As a downside, I feel that the tipping culture is a little exaggerated. I believe that too much is expected in tips. Prices were sometimes confusing because the displayed price is not always the final one, so the final price was pretty much always a surprise. Capitalism is much more pronounced, every businesses tries to make as much money as possible once you go in.

Overall, it was an incredible experience, and we hope to go back one day. We'll probably visit only the West Coast in the same amount of time.

He does construction carpentry. He has decent money at 21. Never been outside of America, hell LA was the only place outside of Pennsylvania that he's been to mainly because his girlfriend wanted to see a concert.

I told him to take an overseas trip. Fuck it, Japan, because it's the biggest culture shock he's ever gonna have in his life. He asked about all these barriers. Passport? Super easy, take your photo at the local Walgreens/CVS, fill out paperwork, mail it in, 6 weeks later you get a passport. Money? Costs less day-to-day to eat and sleep in Japan than it costs in the USA. Conbini food can cost like $3 per meal if you really wanted to. No tips. AirBnB/capsule hotels make it cheap.

She was traveling with her cpap. When she boarded her connecting flight, the flight attendant approached her and said that she couldn‚Äôt carry that on the plane. My sis isn‚Äôt a frequent flyer and has a traumatic brain injury, so she can get confused easily. She asked why she couldn‚Äôt have it and the attendant said it wouldn‚Äôt go in the bin and took it out of my sister‚Äôs hands and walked away without explaining where to retrieve the bag when she landed.

Her cpap did not make it to her destination. We‚Äôve filed a claim and hope it will arrive tomorrow but I‚Äôm angry that they took a medical device away from a disabled person and now she‚Äôs without it.

Any advice on how to escalate this and where as we‚Äôre not getting very far with AA‚Äôs customer service?

Update: I spent some time on the phone with customer service today. The good news is they have located the bag. The really bad news is the cpap will not make it today as they had the wrong tag number in the system. The CS lady was sympathetic and helpful and put a request to get a temporary CPAP sent to my sister tonight. She said to expect a call.

Well, I got a call and they want the prescription which my sister doesn‚Äôt have with her and her doctor‚Äôs office is already closed. So, yeah. The screw up with the tags is leaving her another night without her cpap. ",110,2024-03-22 01:56:34,ComtesseCrumpet,0.95
1djiu10,Recent trip to Switzerland.. my experience and tips,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1djiu10,1110,"My plan was:
3 days zermatt
5 days interlaken and Jungfrau region
3 days Lucerne
1 day Basel


Tips
1. Take advantage of the passes Switzerland offers. It obviously saves money but more importantly gives you the flexibility to take unlimited transport in that region (assuming you take regional pass) which is super useful as you want to visit some peaks only on good weather days which you can only get to know in the morning of that day.

2. I found the below combination to be more useful that Swiss pass 
   - Took the half fare card (gives 50% off on most transports things)
   - Took Bernese overland pass (unlimited free access to most things in interlaken/ Jungfrau region except 3 things:  Jungfrau top of Europe, Schilthon, 
Brienz steam train)
- took peak pass for all things included in Zermatt (super helpful to plan Matterhorn and Gornergret as per good weather days) 

3. Use the SBB app to book most trains and buses and individual mountain websites to book cable cars (most of which you can just take a ticket on the ticket counter). It also has live timetables and holds all your transport tickets in 1 place as QoR codes   Super convenient.

3. Use the meteo Swiss website for accurate weather instead of other apps 

4. Almost all mountain peaks in these regions have their own websites and live cams. Make good use of live cams to plan your day

5. Coop and Migros are generally present almost everywhere. They have pre made and  packed salads and sandwiches which are very convenient for breakfast and picnics. But they usually close at 7-8pm so plan accordingly 

6. Although the days are long but the cable cars close by 6pm generally   So plan them in the day while you can explore the city and hikes post that.  


I had one of my best time in Switzerland. What a great country and people.  
Happy to help in anyway.

\[EDIT: Part of traveling is encountering the occasional scam, cheat, and hustle. You can either learn from them (ideal), worry too much about avoiding them, or find them funny.

2. Flying while comfortable is surreal. I‚Äôm a 240 lbs 6‚Äô1‚Äù guy so am pretty much uncomfortable all 8 hours of every trip.

1d20nxk,VRBO scams scams scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d20nxk/vrbo_scams_scams_scams/,1087,"Just want to leave this here in public:

VRBO is trash. We were on our honeymoon in Scotland and booked a place in Edinburgh. Long story short it was a scam.

I don‚Äôt know what kind of scam this was, but here is what happened: The lister‚Äôs phone number was invalid and they would not respond to us via the VRBO platform, they claimed that the platform didn‚Äôt work for them and needed to switch over to WhatsApp to communicate check-in instructions. On WhatsApp they asked us to wire additional money claiming that we were trying to accommodate more people than we had booked (which was untrue), then told us to go to a different address because he had double booked the listing we had purchased. By then, it was very clear to us that the situation was dangerous. He was unresponsive, until he was insistent, sending bank information for wiring money and weird voice messages where he tried to soothe us. We had nowhere to stay last minute in a city we didn‚Äôt know, with limited cell service.

The true bastard here is VRBO. We tried for 4+ hours to get this message through to them. In the beginning they insisted we go to the original location to confirm it was a scam on our own, in person.  After discussing this scenario with several representatives and hours spent at a lovely rest stop (again, we had nowhere else to go), we eventually convinced them that it wasn‚Äôt safe. This process was arduous. They asked for a call back number and never used it when lo and behold we got disconnected. My head almost exploded from giving my personal info, repeatedly to new representatives with no knowledge of the situation. 

I still have the confirmation code memorized.

As I sit here today at home, VRBO has gone completely radio silent, they haven‚Äôt refunded anything, and we had to spend thousands on last minute hotels in the city. The second night we didn‚Äôt have a place to stay until 5pm and ended up begging a hotel to let us bring a cot into a room so we could sleep. 

It was disgusting and degrading. As with most of these stories it was much darker and shittier than I can put into text. It‚Äôs amazing how royally fucked you can get from these companies. I hope someone reads this and avoids that shit show. Don‚Äôt trust them, they won‚Äôt help you, it will ruin your trip.

As crazy as it sounds, book a hotel, where there is accountability and help available when you need it. ",170,2024-05-27 14:59:27,[deleted],0.94
1e0b0x1,"Exceptions to the ""don't eat in tourist restaurants"" rule:",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e0b0x1/exceptions_to_the_dont_eat_in_tourist_restaurants/,1080,"The recent post about why not to eat in the tourist zones got me to thinking about a couple notable exceptions to that rule. And if people live in a tourist town (I do and I will include an exception in Hawaii), that could be a fantastic resource.

Example #1 -- Bouillon Chartier, Paris

It's steps from Montparnasse station. That area has loads of tourist-trap restaurants and fast food, including a Burger King.

And if someone visited Paris and ate at Bouillon Chartier for lunch and dinner every single day, I wouldn't blame them. Why? Unironic French classics served inexpensively in an Art Deco dining room that is straight out of a old postcard of the City of Light.

A three-course meal for two, with wine, will set a couple back maybe 50 Euro. And it's an ideal place to bring children to introduce them to French cuisine in an unstuffy, accessible way.

Who's going to be there? Tourists. French tourists visiting Paris and a LOT of Asian tourists.

Example #2 -- Din Tai Fung, Taipei.

This is a tourist destination in itself inside Taipei 101. It's a little overpriced (but honestly, not much). These are popping up in California and Las Vegas. And a meal of soup dumplings will taste great and won't break the bank.

You'd never hear me say ""no"" to a ""let's go to Taipei 101 and get some dumplings."" Not happening.

Example #3 -- Super J's, Captain Cook Hawaii

Since I promised, here's a small place in Hawaii. This is Hawaiian food made by Hawaiians for Hawaiians. (Actually, it's for everyone -- but I almost never see tourists here.) The food is inexpensive and delicious. Ambiance and view aren't all that much. But this is one of a handful of places that isn't heating Sysco food and selling it for fine-dining prices.

1gf07i8,Roadtrip in Zimbabwe ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gf07i8,1073,"My husband and I spent a few months traveling in Africa, with Zimbabwe being our fifth country on the trip. We spent 14 days in late May/early June, and fell deeply in love with the country and it's people. We rented a car and spent 10 days driving here: 
- 1 night in Harare 
- 3 nights in Eastern Highlands 
- 3 nights in Gonarezhou National Park
- 2 nights by Great Zimbabwe Ruins 
Then took an overnight Greyhound bus cross-country from Harare to Victoria Falls, and capped it off with 2 nights at the falls. Wish we'd allocated more time to Zim, it's an awesome place.  

Ended up being our second favorite country after Namibia (out of 10 total). Its obvious that Zimbabwe had hit a failed state status, but seems to be making progress on rising out of that. Tons of construction to repave or build new roads, zero police bribing (something that was prevalent), and they even have KFC which feels promising! Based on what I'd read online from older forums we were expecting far worse conditions and were genuinely surprised at the current state of things. Money was the primary logistical nightmare for us - they use USD which can be pulled at every ATM...if your bank let's you. Chase was not a fan so ended up being a huge headache. We were only able to use credit cards in a few spots in Harare and Vic Falls.

We rented a car from a small family business in Harare, total fucking beater but we drove on some seriously shitty 4x4 roads out in the highlands and it did its job. It was great to have in Gonarezhou where we did self drive safari, just kept to the main roads and had an awesome time. The majority of the roads in Zim are in good condition, but when they're not they are terrible (like an hour driving on washboard, slowly losing my sanity). 

Safety was a non-issue, we never felt unsafe at any point on our trip. 

Used a mix of Airbnb, direct bookings, and booking.com for hotels. Scanning Google Maps in specific locations turned out to be a good idea for finding hotels that aren't on the bigger websites, found a couple of gems that way. If going to Vic Falls I would stay on the Zim side vs Zambia. 

Our esims sucked ass, if going get a physical sim card in Harare. ",32,2024-10-29 12:26:47,chokemypinky,0.99

As an American living in the post-9/11 travel world, it is a huge no-no to leave bags unattended anywhere in the airport, so not sure if this is a rule internationally as well but want to hear from others who might know more. Here goes:

I arrived at the airport for my flight quite early and my gate had not yet been announced when I got to the terminal, so I decided just to choose a random gate to sit at until I figured out where I was going. As I was sitting, I noticed a woman traveling alone who approached a seat just across from me with a purse and a duffel bag. All of a sudden, she left her duffel bag on the seat and immediately started walking away and didn't look back. I watched her speed walk all the way down the terminal until I couldn't see her anymore (she wasn't walking to the bathroom btw, because the bathroom was directly behind where I was sitting and she was walking away from it), and all that was running through my head was announcements that I've heard in airports in the past: ""... if you notice a bag or piece of luggage that has been left unattended, report it immediately.""

I walked up to the nearest gate attendent and explained to her what I just saw, and I expected her to let someone else know so they can investigate the bag. Instead, she explained to me that every piece of luggage that is in the terminal has been through security so it most likely wouldn't be a threat and that many people who don't have the means or don't want to pay for their baggage will just leave it behind at the airport.

I suppose it makes sense that if it has gone through security then it is most likely fine, but it still freaked me out and it doesn't completely make sense to me why someone would leave a bag like that and walk towards the terminal exit. I decided to sit at a different gate just in case my hunches were correct, and eventually departed on my plane. What do others think?

So since I cook at home and this a holiday, I really do not want to even prepare a sandwich in the morning. On top of that, to me, traveling is partly about discovering a city's culinary scene, whether that's a rundown local diner, a cool cafe or an upscale restaurant.

Our routine so far has been for my partner and me to grab a specialty coffee and breakfast, meet them for sightseeing, then head off for a lunch by ourselves and then we come back and after some time go take a walk and have a dinner, The other couple isn't upset or passive-aggressive about this, but I do feel a little bad going off without them.

So, for those who don't eat out much while traveling, how do you usually handle meals on trips? Do you want to stick with the routine from hom? And if you've traveled with friends who enjoy eating out, how did you balance things so that everyone could enjoy their preferred style of travel?",401,2024-10-27 14:49:55,Mindless-Energy3872,0.82

It's mid-morning. I spot an interesting restaurant with menuboard outside. Nobody around whatsoever. I sidle up slowly trying not to rustle the gravel underfoot, keeping cool, read the word 'appetisers'..

Menu Guardian:  &lt;emerges from bush, cigarette in hand&gt;: ""Hey! Welcome! We have fish! We have chicken! You like?  &lt;gestures to menu with cigarette butt pointing at the words 'fish' and 'chicken' written in English&gt; .

""Also SALAD!"" &lt;points repeatedly and enthusiastically at word 'Salad'&gt;

Me: Um, thank you. I don't need any help right now.

Menu Guardian: Where you from?

Me (internally): From a place where I can be left alone to look at a menu just for one moment?

Me (externally): ..England.

Me: &lt;valiantly attempt to avoid elongated conversation about exactly how close in relation to London I live and exactly how close that is to the relative of the menu guardian who lived in England 10 years ago and the football club that both they and I support, and instead try to read beyond the word 'appetisers'&gt;

Menu guardian &lt;voice escalating in volume and urgency&gt;: Everything here good. All GOOD! Mama in kitchen!

Me: Uh-huh, good to know, thanksbyenow! &lt;fervently tries to release hand that was gripped without me even realising&gt;

I love to look at a good menu. Pore over it, have a ponder as to what I might enjoy and whether the price is good. Google maps isn't the same.

But these guys are 24x7 eatery ninjas. I swear you could pitch up at 3am to the front of their restaurant and they'd be backflipping out of their balcony window in their dressing gowns, landing on top of their menu in protective stance to advise you breathlessly that ""prices very good! best in town!'

Canada is so great!!!! Especially in Banff!! The country parks are so beautiful, the lakes are just like emerald. Also, the ice cream I ate in downtown is so yummy!üòã 

One more thing is the people in Canada, they are much nicer than the people in my country, like they will say good morning to stranger on the street and greet each other. I think that is so kind and people should also do it in my country

He asked what flight we were checking in for which is actually something that happens at Lima airport at the doors. He then told us check in had closed and we needed to talk to the Latam Airways office to rebook.

As we were in a rush and not thinking we followed him out of the airport and he pointed at a Latam Airways building saying main office. We then walked out of the airport carpark and 100m down the road to an airline ticket office with all the brands. 

(Had dodgy Vibes at this point as soon as we left the carpark)

We were then told it was our fault that we were late which it was and that it was going to have to buy completely new flights. We found and article from 12 years ago warning about this and left without paying etc.

Please be aware if this happens don't leave the airport please talk to the staff at the check in counters!!

1gbdmro,Thoughts on India After 3 Weeks,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gbdmro/thoughts_on_india_after_3_weeks/,999,"For the longest time I had wanted to travel to India. This year I made the decision to go in October for three weeks. I wanted to go with an open mind, so I didn't spoil myself by reading threads or watching youtube videos. I really wanted to give it a fair chance.

Here are my honest opinions on India as a white foreigner (male):

The pros:
- Everything is much (much) cheaper than the US or similar Western countries. You can stay at hotels and eat at restaurants for very little. Uber is inexpensive.

- There is a real sense of camaraderie amongst Indians. I really felt their care for each other

- Electronic payment system UPI is super convenient

- Roadside stalls make getting food really simple

- Despite the commotion and squalor of most streets/places I found people to be generally happier than in the West. Not as aggitated or stressed.

- The pace is much faster than in the West. People don't waste time with superficialities. People  aren't fake and don't care about your follower count or stupid things like that.

- It's super easy to eat vegetarian. 

- The family unit is very strong. There is a real bond in families that I find lacking in the West. 

Cons:

- There is trash literally everywhere. No one seems to care about the mounds of trash. They only add to it. Air pollution is common.

- It is very crowded in pretty much any urban area during the day time. It can be exhausting dodging people and cars everywhere you go because people will cut you off and don't seem to have a sense of personal space.

- As a white foreigner you are seen as a limitless source of money. I did not mind overpaying for things but in many cases I felt outright swindled and would be approached by people everywhere for tips/rides/guides. I was exhausted by it.

- A lot of places felt like they were designed simply for tourists to spend money. I would be shepherded around by my driver to various subpar restaurants/shops and in many cases be asked to pay exorbitant prices for things I didn't want or need. I just wanted to experience India without the added stress of tourist traps at every turn. It felt like I wasn't experiencing the real India and only a touristy version designed to appease my assumed ""white sensibilities"".

- Most people are devoutly religious and I feel like they use their religion as an excuse to defend poor decisions. The religious fervour is a lot to take in because it is constant and over the top.

- I found most menus to be cookie cutter copies of each other. I got tired of the exact same hotel menu copy and pasted everywhere I went. It was impossible to eat healthy because everything was laden with oil and sugar. Even things that are supposed to be healthy like fruit juices are filled with sugar. When I went to order items on a menu a lot of times they would say the item is unavailable. This happened numerous times.

- Even though most things are written in English, most people don't speak it fluently except maybe in tourist spots. It can be discouraging when you want to communicate but everyone's speaking Hindi

Even though there were a lot of cons for me, India made me feel alive for the first time in a long time. I felt like the relentless noise, crowds and energy of the place keeps you on your toes. This can be exciting in small doses. Would I go back? Actually, I probably would, but this time I would be much more careful about scams and tourist traps and ideally go with an Indian friend.

Disneyland was so much fun I‚Äôm going to cancel my Iceland trip next year I was planning on going to and booking a trip to disneyworld.

The amazing artwork in these parks is crazy. I was on the guardians of the galaxy ride and rocket looked literally lifelike just 5 feet away from me.

The live performance at the end with Mickey dancing and the fireworks was just.. chefs kiss! 

I used to always think why spend an arm and a leg for an amusement park when going to Europe is the same price? 

You know what? Those people have a point. International trips are such a pain in the ass. 

Disneyland from the entire day you‚Äôre there feels like dopamine magic the entire time. Even the line queues are incredibly decorated and unique.

19ep78j,My Lufthansa experience and something I learned,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19ep78j/my_lufthansa_experience_and_something_i_learned/,989,"In lieu of ""Avoid Lufthansa"" thread, I wanted to share my experience with that shitty airline. Timeline is August 2022. 

I flew Lufthansa multiple times as a Canadian. Worst customer service, terrible fucking attitude and absolutely incompetent staff. But what happened on this flight was just on another level.

I flew to Central Asia (3 layovers in this flight, first layover was delayed by 28 hours) and I almost got kicked out of the flight by Lufthansa steward and by Lufthansa representative from the airport. Their ground crew made a mistake and didn't include me on the final flight's manifest (even if I have all my tickets and documents in order). During the final layover (in which you don't leave the airplane, they just pick up extra passengers), they told me to leave the plane because I wasn't on the manifest. I did however have all my boarding passes, documents, etc. but steward didn't care. I refused and didn't leave my seat. They got Lufthansa rep from airport and border police come talk to me. They tried to convince me to leave the plane and talk to them in their office to ""fix"" the situation. I stood my ground and didn't leave my seat. If they wanted to use force, idgaf, I know my rights. Entire flight was held because of that. Captain of the airplane came out of his cockpit, to figure out what was the situation. I explained that there was a mistake on Lufthansa's part, I have my ticket to my final destination and that their staff were trying to get me out of the plane. Entire time I was extremely calm and understanding, I know customer service jobs are difficult but I was on the verge of losing it. Captain personally apologized to me, and said that I was right to NOT leave the plane, otherwise I would've lost my rights as a flight passenger. He told them to fuck off and I got to my final destination. Got a bottle of champagne from their steward and a piece of paper with information on where I can submit my complaint.

Anyways, my 40 hour, 3 layover flight became 70 hour flight, with being threatened by Lufthansa's staff, border police and almost getting kicked out of the flight I paid for. Oh, also they lost my check-in bags for an entire week as well, that was cherry on top.

No one ever got back to me on my complaint and it took Lufthansa 9 months to give my refund for the hotel + damages for 28 hours delay on my first layover. No word on the situation that happened on the plane, they just ignored it.  

P.S. If airline reps are trying to get you to leave the plane to talk to them in their office, DO NOT. Otherwise you lose your flight privileges, regardless if you have the ticket/boarding pass on hand. Captains make a final decision.

P.P.S If there is anyone from Lufthansa reading this and not believing that this actually happened, I can DM you the FB ID that was submitted to LH's support.",224,2024-01-24 13:40:49,uracil,0.91

1d8bhxq,Experiences of racism/uncomfortable interactions with strangers as an East Asian (-American) tourist in Italy,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d8bhxq/experiences_of_racismuncomfortable_interactions/,974,"

Just went to Italy for the second time, and surprisingly this time I actually had a lot of uncomfortable/rude encounters that I feel like I can attribute to racism. I am sharing this just so other POC can prepare themselves on just what might be expected, as these details aren‚Äôt shared in travel guides usually.

When I went to Rome, there was this guy eating with his family who kept staring nonstop at us during dinner. Like, as soon as we were directed to the table, he started staring at us with an unwelcoming and exasperated expression. It proceeded almost unwaveringly, and I had enough when he started looking at one of my party member‚Äôs phone screen and then rolling his eyes. So I asked him if he had an issue, and he proceeded to act clueless. I told him to stop staring, that he knew what he was doing, and to set a better example for his young son. He wanted to argue saying that he wasn‚Äôt doing anything but his mom and wife (?) stopped him, and I told him if he had any issue he could talk to the waiter about it, and I would talk to the waiter if he kept staring. I could tell that his family was very uncomfortable with the whole situation and they ate in silence after that.

Before we left he apologized and tried to act really nice and told us he wasn‚Äôt a racist lmao (which ironically, through this disclosure, revealed that the issue at hand was indeed my race)

I was honestly kind of fed up because i was at the Milano Centrale train station earlier that day and some girl cut me in line for food, and I confronted her about it. She seemed a little surprised that I spoke English or something, and she gave two separate excuses. When I didn‚Äôt give into her bs she was like ""you know I tried to be polite"" and stormed off.

And while aboard the train to Rome, I was walking to my seat, and there were so many older Italian people who just kept staring at me. The train that I was on had seating in a table configuration, so you had to face the next row of people on board across a table. Funnily enough, I sat next to a (white) American couple visiting and across the aisle there were 2 older Italian ladies who seemed to be staring at me. I stared back and they would look away but I found them staring at me more. I don‚Äôt think they stared at all at the other American couple, who frankly were speaking pretty loudly in English

My assessment is that they are used to treating asians from their home countries poorly because they can usually get away with it. In my case, as an East Asian American, I feel like they think they can pull this type of stuff because east asians from asia generally aren't privy to what racism/microaggressions look like, and even if they are, they usually dont feel comfortable enough expressing themselves to do anything about it.

At the train station in Milan, we were stopped by a group of military/police officers who asked to see my passport for verification. I questioned it and asked if I could see ID or a badge because I was wary that it was a scam (have heard of something similar before), and one of the officers said show it to me right now or else you‚Äôre going to get in trouble and he put his hand on his baton or gun. Once they saw my US passport they started apologizing and asked me if I needed any help with directions.

1dngdt4,I had a horrendous experience on my flight yesterday.,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dngdt4/i_had_a_horrendous_experience_on_my_flight/,972,"I am just angry and want feedback, and if this isnt the proper venue I will remove it. 

Flying from Philadelphia to Chicago-Midway. Flight is delayed an hour. They load us on the plane. We end up sitting on the runway for an hour and a half. So now we are two and a half hours late. No communication and the flight attendants, one in particular are weirdly antagonizing and taking a condescending tone with some passengers. The pilot says it could be 5 minutes or a half hour before we take off, turns into that hour and a half.

Flight finally takes off. passengers are actually decently well behaved. Man behind me gets into an argument with this particular flight attendant about her flippant attitude mocking passengers for being upset.

Flight lands. plane finally pulls up to the gate. Finally! The power goes off. The door isn't opening. This cant be happening right? No announcement. 15 minutes pass. I stand up (late edit: pilot turned off seatbelt sign and everyone was standing in the aisle waiting to deplane) and that one flight attendant says something ,and I laugh, I thought she was making a joke, I dont know, I was tired, but I was laughing along with her, assuming how ridiculous it was that now they couldnt open the door. She looks at me and says, ""What are you laughing at?"". She was serious. She was antagonizing me on purpose. I said how the hell are you mocking us for being on a flight that is at this point 4 hours late and they cant open the door. She takes this patronizing tone with me, and is really fucking rude. I cant believe it, and start giving it back to her,, ""How can you be mocking passengers who are stuck like this?? and we are going back and forth. Her coworker tries to tell her to stop. the guy behind me starts defending me and my wife wants to disappear into her chair (I write this to say that confrontations makes her uncomfortable and she does not like when it happens. She agreed with me, but was embarrassed and nervous at the whole thing. It was not an example of, oh here goes ruddiver again embarrassing me in public with his rage and anger. I just want to set the scene. I am also not absolving myself of all blame. I may have escalated the argument with the attendant, or I did, not may have)

Another half hour goes by and some other passengers start ranting, ,rightfully so, that they are going to call Frontier or maybe 911 and say we are trapped on a plane. Which I may have been encouraging as my temper and exhaustion was very high.

The flight attendant gets on the announcement and says that if people making threats law enforcement will be meeting us when the door opens. People were joking/not joking about kicking the door to open it. The door was opened after an hour. Police were there. No incidents. I did not get the offending flight attendants name and I am not sure what to do about it. This was an idiotic experience, and I feel unresolved. Not the flight delays, it was horrendous, but that shit happens.

Thanks for listening to my ted talk. It was flight 4367 out of Philadelphia yesterday if that matters.

edit:  I want to make clear that there were three other flight attendants where were very nice and had empathy for us. They were letting people use the bathroom when the light was still on, I thought they handled it well. It was just the one. They were not making enough announcements about what was going on, in my opinion, but nothing egregious.",317,2024-06-24 10:33:54,Ruddiver,0.85

I don‚Äôt wanna add too many details to the post to make it overwhelming to read, but I will answer any and all questions with enthusiasm, it‚Äôs my favorite thing to talk about. It was not a vacation for relaxing (which is what we wanted), even though the ship does a great job in making sure that whatever downtime you do have, it‚Äôs enjoyable. 

The basics are we went on a 9 day all inclusive cruise with atlas ocean voyages. 2 days crossing the drake, 5 days exploring, and 2 days crossing back to Ushuaia. We paid extra to do kayaking and camping, all landings and zodiac rides were included.

Every night before dinner, the ship had briefings with the expedition team, which was a group of 12 professionals from a whole bunch of different expertise and experience, telling us our plans for following day. They attempted two landings a day, if the weather or water didn‚Äôt cooperate, they would try to find a suitable location that was safe. If not, you just spend the day on the ship and enjoy the scenery from inside. They would educate us on what we did end up doing as far as where we went and some of the things we saw.

Maybe it‚Äôs a me problem, but for me a flight isn‚Äôt much more than a bus - it‚Äôs a way for me to get from A to B. Yes, the seating may be uncomfortable and the food is probably shit.

Nobody seems to pay that much heed to Greyhound in the US or National Express in the UK being shit - it‚Äôs just a way to get around.

A lot of culture, some gruesome history (killing caves) and wonderful nature! Watching thousands and thousands of Bats flying out of a cave was a one of a kind travel experience! 

Then took a bus to Phnom Penh, the capital. Spent about 3 days there. Pretty nice! The temples, grand palace and the museums were the highlights. 

Before flying out of Phnom Penh back to India, visited the Koh Rong Sanloem Islands which were so vast and empty! Few tourists and nothing else. Some of the most secluded beaches we've ever been to.

1b6fooe,"Traveling with two friends, they're essentially ignoring me",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1b6fooe/traveling_with_two_friends_theyre_essentially/,907,"Hello,

sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this.

I am 4 days deep into a 2-week trip with two ex-coworkers, one guy and one girl. I was closer with the guy, but friendly with both.

Throughout most of the trip, they have been essentially ignoring me. They pay attention exclusively to each other 90% of the time, with the girl seemingly trying to intentionally exclude me from plans and activities, and the guy seemingly just following along. He still talks to me every now and then, but she will only do so reluctantly.

I am very sensitive to social rejection, and I might be taking this harder than someone else would.

I thought we were on good terms, and while working together would often stay way past our shift hours and just talk. I was aware that we were both closer to the guy than to each other, but I never imagined it was this bad.

I don't know if she's into him and she's annoyed that I'm physically there, or if she just secretely hated me all this time, or whatever.

We have our current apartment booked for five more nights and are looking into what to do with the rest of the days. I don't know what to do. I was bullied a lot as a kid and this feels like I'm reliving those situations, only 20 years older. I really just wanna go home.

I value my friendship with him and would try to talk to him, but she seems to always be glued to him wherever he goes. I really don't know what to do. Should I just confront them directly, like ask ""you guys have a problem with me???"" Should I get angry and make a scene? I can't demand people to like me or want to talk to me; it doesn't even make sense.

Just being in the same house as them while they're talking exclusively to each other and not engaging me feels extremely uncomfortable, and I've just been spending as much time outside on my own as possible.

I'm also spending a lot more money on this trip than I can reasonably afford because the guy really insisted he wanted to go. I really don't know how to approach this situation. I feel too emotionally riled up to come up with a logical solution.

Maybe this belongs to friendship_advice, or whatever. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds.

Edit: I've been thinking about the fact that I'm from the south of Europe, while they're both from more northern countries, and cultural differences might be playing a role here. Maybe part of the ""coldness"" I feel it's just their behaviour not matching my expectations. Or maybe I'm gaslighting myself?

Edit 2: So I talked to the guy. He admitted he had noticed that some dynamics and some things she did felt ""weird"" and just like she was trying to push me aside. He apologized for his part in it. He mentioned that he had noticed his connection with her grow and get stronger during these days, and he's not sure as to whether he actually wants to start dating her or not. He also feels like this situation is an unfortunate consequence of the two of them bonding more with each other, which would not be an issue if we were more than three people. He mentioned that he really wanted this trip to be ""the three of us"" and wouldn't like to let any relationship-y stuff ruin that. Anyway, he wants to talk to her in private and see what her stance and expectations are, and go from there. Since I got a lot more replies than I was expecting, I will update you guys in the end so you'll at least know how it went.

Edit 3: Several of you have been PMing me so I'll update it here. The guy has told me that, although they're ""not dating"", he sees them going in that direction. They want to move to a hotel room together. I've gotten a hostel bed relatively nearby (the options weren't plentiful). He has tried to be understanding of the situation, but I think self-interest trumps all in the end. The idea is to still meet up to do activities and visit things. I have not talked with the girl nor do I plan to, and she seems to have no interest in a direct conversation either. I don't know how things will settle after the trip.

I would also like to use this opportunity to thank everyone who has written to me, either in the post or PMs. It is hard to go through these things when you're several thousand kilometers from anyone who cares about you, and it was great to feel I had people who heard and understood me.

Help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ab8g4i/just_booked_a_nonrefundable_hotel_by_accident/,896,"I went to book a hotel for a work trip in March this afternoon using the Chase travel portal. I accidentally clicked a non-refundable fare, and didn't notice until the checkout screen.

I immediately called Chase Travel and sat on the phone for over an hour while two agents tried to call the hotel to get them to allow me to cancel and change the fare. Apparently the hotel refused both times.

I called the hotel directly and spoke to the manager. He refused to help me. He simply kept saying it was policy, and he only said I could try the Toronto Marriott reservations office.

That office said they couldn't even see my reservation, and only the manager (who I'd just talked to) would be able to do anything about it.

I called the benefits department of my credit card (Chase Sapphire Reserve) and they told me there was nothing they could do because my scenario didn't fall under an approved case.

I'm so frustrated and upset. I don't know if this work trip is happening. I don't know if my company will be in business then or not. My finger slipped.

Is there anything I can do, or do I just need to eat the $1,000 loss?

Edit: Huzzah! After 4 hours on the phone, I was finally able to get this stay cancelled. All it took, as one comment suggested, was the managers at the hotel changing shift. If you're in this situation and finding this thread, be persistent.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ebpa17/what_was_your_im_travelling_solo_from_now_moment/,888,"For me it was when I visited Czechia with my university mates. Now, we are completely different personalities - I want to visit museums, see every historical monument I can, try the local food, explore as much of the city as possible and learn as much as I can within a short time frame about a country's history...

My friends were on a different wavelength. They mostly wanted to do restaurant/bar hopping, they somehow chose the most overpriced tourist trap restaurants when the local options were better and cheaper, and they didn't even care about seeing anything different to talk about back home. It made me wonder, if you're only going to sit at bars and restaurants what's the point of going to a different country, why not do the same stuff at home?

I enjoyed the time spent with my friends but I just wish we explored even a little bit.

Then I went to Turkey with my dad and holy hell did he complain...""Why is there no espresso, why do i have to bargain for everything, why is it so hot"" it was non stop complaining. I really wanted to visit some historical landmarks and museums but he was against that because he doesn't care about ""some old buildings"". The complaining got so unbearable, I had to cancel the trip and book a private closed all inclusive resort. Then he was finally happy...

I understand people are different so that's why if I want to visit a country, I will only travel either solo or with my gf who also loves travel. So many seem to travel and then complain that it's not like back home, why even waste your time making the trip in the first place? ",423,2024-07-25 02:56:07,Elegant-Passion2199,0.95

COST: Seoul. It‚Äôs not very expensive. you can get a decent hotel for like $30-50usd a night. public transit, food, alcohol are all pretty cheap. Tokyo gets pricey fast by comparison. 

PUBLIC TRANSIT: Seoul, by a slight margin. The metro system is amazing and easy to navigate. The busses are great too. Tokyo‚Äôs is remarkable and fascinating but can be very very confusing if you don‚Äôt speak Japanese.

WEATHER: Tokyo. Winter is prohibitively cold in Seoul.

FOOD: Tokyo. Not even really comparable IMO. Food in Seoul is good, food in Tokyo is better than anywhere else on Earth.

FOREIGNER FRIENDLY: Seoul. Everything is bilingual English/Korean in terms of signage, menus etc. Neither city has a high level of English proficiency but Seoul‚Äôs is marginally better.

PEOPLE: Tokyo. Japanese people are unimaginably welcoming and Tokyo feels absurdly safe. Korean people are more distant (to foreigners) and at nighttime there are too many drunk people around, it can feel sketchy. 

NIGHTLIFE: Seoul. Koreans know how to party. Tokyo felt sleepy during the week.

It was a confronting trip because I traveled with my best friend and it turned out that our expectations were *very* different even in terms of budget, so I was constantly questioning life, I also didn‚Äôt feel like I got to experience and enjoy most of the cities the way I would have done so by myself.

Just wondering  what are my rights here? Should I expect any compensation? Is it worth complaining? 

We were flying Ryanair from London to Porto, and literally 10 mins from landing in porto, the flight gets re-routed to Madrid due to bad weather. So over an hour and we land in Madrid. We are then stuck on the tarmac at Madrid for 4 hours while they made a decision about whether we get off at Madrid or they re-fuel and take us back to Porto. I run out of water to make milk for my 8 month old daughter. They won't give out bottled water for free and their payment system was broken. Honestly the panic i felt that I wouldn't be able to feed my baby.

I started crying, other passengers were offering me their water.  
After much pleading, they gave me ONE bottle of water.
We were on the plane for 7 hrs in total, for what was meant to be a 2h20 flight.

My main issue is that it seems to be their policy to not give out water, regardless of however long we are stranded on the plane. How is that legal?

I'm writing this because this is my first time getting pickpocketed and I've always wondered how they actually do it. Now I know, so I'm offering you the chance to learn from my mistake, since just telling someone ""You should watch your stuff in the metro"" doesn't actually work.

The setup:

1. The scene of the crime is the metro station at the platform where you're actually getting on the train.
2. You need several people. In my case, I think 4 were involved.
3. The victim needs to hold a phone or a wallet in any of their pockets. I had my phone in my front right pocket of slim fit jeans.

The execution:

1. Wait for the victim to start getting onto the train.
2. Two people follow it closely behind. Another two cut fast in front of it.
3. The two in the front stop right at the doors and make a dramatic gesture like ""Oh no, this is the wrong train"".
4. The two in the front start exiting the train, but in a way that they are blocking you from getting in and pushing you out instead. The two at the back push you forward, so you're sandwiched between all four of them.
5. While you're getting pushed from all sides, one of them slips his hand into your pocket. At this time you can hear the sound signal that the train doors are about to close.
6. They all move off the train, you hurry onto the train, the doors close.

You have a total of 2 seconds to react at most, so if you're not expecting it, it's almost impossible to notice it right then and there.

Upon check-in for my return flight, I decided to pay for an upgrade to business class. $700+ later, my card was charged and life was good. The next morning, I get to CDG and decided to drop off my baggage in the Sky Priority line. All of a sudden, with less than two hours before my flight, while I was still in line to drop off my baggage, my seat was changed to Premium Economy on my electronic boarding pass. I thought it was an accident, and that I had time, so I went to speak to a woman at the check-in counter to see if she could correct the mistake. 

She calls a few numbers, spoke to several people and then to two managers. Meanwhile, my seat was once again changed but this time to Economy on my electronic boarding pass.

I kept stressing to the agent and her managers how quickly my boarding time was approaching and they assured me it would be fine. One and a half hours later, and I am freaking out as I have not even made it through security yet. Finally, they said that unfortunately, there was a ‚Äúmechanical failure‚Äù with my seat in business class so I had to be downgraded. I was very confused as I was downgraded twice but I said fine and at that point I just cared about making it to my gate. 

I get through security and run to make it to the gate just 10 minutes before my departure and miraculously they still let me board. To say that I was stressed and sweating like a pig at a county fair was an understatement. 

I walk past my ‚Äúbroken‚Äù business class seat and lo and behold! A young man is sitting in it just chilling.

When visiting the Metropolitan museum in NYC she went extremely close to the paintings, almost touching them with her nose. I pointed this out to her but she refused to step any further. Luckily one of the guards noticed how close she came to a painting of Monet and told her to back up. Another example can be found in her refusing to stand on the right side of the escalators in the new york metro, even after i told her this was common courtesy as to make it easier for the people who were in a hurry.  When visiting Mount Vernon, ‚ÄúGeorge Washington‚Äôs residence‚Äù, she climbed onto the slave memorial built for the slaves owned by Washington to get a ‚Äúbetter picture‚Äù of the surroundings. 

But the real shitshow started on our third and last day in Washington DC. We decided to visit the museum of African American culture and history and the Supreme court and Library of congress afterwards. After working through the underground levels of the museum we decided to get to the exit, since it was nearly 2pm and we still wanted to see the supreme court and library of congress. Suddenly a girl approached us and asked my friend if she still recognized her in dutch. One way or another my friend didn‚Äôt hear that the girl spoke to her in dutch, our native language, and only went back to her after i encouraged her to do so. Turned out to be some classmate of hers from middle school. Friend made it clear that my presence was unwanted and sent me off to wander solo in the museum. I thought this little reunion would take 20-something minutes (since it was just a random classmate from 15 years ago she didn‚Äôt even recognize) but boy was i wrong. After half an hour i texted her since we still had our reservations for the library of congress, without any success. After an hour i decided to look for her, without any result because of the sheer size of the museum (6-7 massive floors). I also could‚Äôt exit the museum and go to supreme court and library of congress myself because only she knew the code of our locker (with our passports etc inside). We saw each other again at the exit of the museum some 15 minutes before closing, a dozen unanswered calls and messages later. I immediately confronted her, told her that she could at least keep me up to date and that she wasted my afternoon and chance to visit the Court and library. She didn‚Äôt acknowledge my anger as justified and suggested i was jealous because she spent time with someone else (while she went back to her classmate because i encouraged her to do so). I didn‚Äôt spoke to her for the remaining two days of the trip. 
How would you react in a situation like this? Was my frustration justified or was i overreacting? 

Some context: first time visit to the United States  for me(24M) and my close friend (24F), both from Belgium. We landed in New York, explored it for 5 days, took the flixbus to Washington for 3 days and then a quick overnight trip to Harpers Ferry West Virginia before flying out of Washington. We have traveled extensively before to various destinations (Georgia, Iceland, Italy and Namibia) before without any problems.

Once there I was geared up with protection harness and had to climb a ladder through the left hand. At the end you arrive at a very small plateform located behind the shield, I give you some pictures so you can see the view yourself!

I did a 4 month roadtrip last year and I absolutely loved American food.

**Texas**\- the smoked brisket, BBQ and carne asada!! oh and buccees food  
**California**\-the best chimichanga and tacos of my life  
**PNW**\-I really loved the seafood and jellies but they were too expensive (the huckleberry). Also had homemade meatloaf at a diner and chicken fried steak! I also tried some clam chowder that was fn good.  
**Montana**\-Tried bison and elk burger!  
**New England**\-OMG that lobster roll was amazing, but too expensive. Whoppie pies were good. Cider donoughts were overrated though (from that popular place).  
**Nashville-** Hot chicken. OMG. I don't know what to say here... I still have dreams of that amazing chicken lol.  
\*\*\*\*The South-\*\*\*\*I spent most of my budget here, but I couldn't get enough of soul food and cajun/creole dishes. Loved the alligator too. Will come back for more I promise

I couldn't try more but hoping to do another roadtrip soon to other States. I found some food here just as impressive as the foods I tried in my trip to Peru soon after.

I also tried fast food chains along the way (like Zaxbys, Culvers, and others) but I don't count that as part of the cuisines even though they were pretty good. I also went in to Mcdonald's once just for the restroom and was shocked at the quantity of foreign tourists ordering food from there.

If that sounds vaugely familiar, I was the 17yr (now 18) year old who was freaking out. I am happy to report that I took the (genuine) advice to heart and was able to let go of most of the fear.  As many of you predicted, it was absolutely the best week of my life and I genuinely cannot wait to go back with a friend. 

Here is what we did: 
my grandma and I got there on the 27th, and we stayed a day and a half in Athens, before boarding the cruise ship on Saturday. We skipped the first excursion, just because we needed time to settle in, but after that we did the majority of them, including taking a detailed tour through Ephesus, and going to a Turkish rug making place. (That excursion was definitely my favorite). We also went to Crete. I didn't really grasp the concept of ""shoulder to shoulder foot traffic"" until we were in  Oia Village in Santorini; still, absolutely gorgeous! If I'm being honest, I did a lot more exploring than my Grandma. 

    I am very happy with the trip and am also happy to be home! It's a weird balance, lol. 
But I just  wanted to give an update, to let anyone who is interested know that the trip got back on track :) There was a lot I was interested in but either didn't have the time, or was unable because I needed to be with my grandma (which was fine!)

I was the last one in a room of 8 to leave the room this morning so I was around when the housekeeper changed the sheets and everything.

We have lockers in our rooms and I was getting ready to go out but I went to the bathroom in the hallway quickly so I thought it's not worth locking my stuff for one minute. I just closed the door to our dormitory. 

I was washing my hands and I hear rustling sounds coming from our room. And idk why but I felt like something was wrong and I rushed to the room. The housekeeper that cleaned the room earlier was elbow deep into my locker and the moment she saw me she threw what she had in her hands back in the locker. I was shocked and looked at her in disbelief. 

She immediately panicked and started stuttering but she didn't speak English so she called the hostel keeper to talk to me. She just reassured me that the housekeeper saw the locker open and was about to go downstairs to ask for a locker so my stuff can be safe when I'm gone. Which...fine, but why would she go through my stuff? Why not just directly go downstairs and ask for the locker without tampering with my items? 

I don't want to cause a fuss but I feel really uncomfortable with what happened.

1.  People are pretty much the same everywhere.  Some are very kind, some are very unkind, and most are somewhere in between.

2.  Most people don't really care about you or where you're from. 

3.  While you're walking around, catching the sights, eating good food, etc., the local people are going about their day-to-day lives working at jobs that they may or may not like.  You're on vacation and they're not.  What's fun and new for you may just be a boring drudgery to the local people.

4.  Of course there are variations, but mountains, streams, forests, and beaches often look fairly similar from one country or continent to another.

5.  More than anything, traveling is just fun.  I don't consider it an accomplishment, and I don't believe that it has somehow made me more well-rounded as a person.  I just think of it as a fun hobby.  ",408,2024-04-28 16:27:35,stanerd,0.92

1cwhb2x,I went to Kazakhstan for two weeks (Trip Report),https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cwhb2x/i_went_to_kazakhstan_for_two_weeks_trip_report/,785,"I just returned from two weeks in Kazakhstan, which included a 9-hour layover in Warsaw (great city, a lot more modern than expected). It was one of the best countries I've been to! I had found tickets from Chicago to Astana for only $1k, so I went ahead and bought them, and that was the majority of my budget because I always stay at the cheapest places I can find.

A quick outline of my itinerary:

Astana - 4 nights

Karaganda - 2 nights

(overnight train to Almaty)

Saty - 1 night, as part of a short road trip to Charyn Canyon and Kolsai Lake

Almaty - 5 nights

Astana - 1 night

Some general thoughts:

* I had visited Kyrgyzstan a few years ago, so I was already a fan of Central Asia, and I wanted to return to the region. Even then, Kazakhstan exceeded my expectations. Its cities felt European and although the north is very flat, the south's geography is incredible. It felt like being in Colorado and Utah, with 1% of the tourists.
* Astana is the strangest city I've been to, only because I haven't been to Ashgabat or Pyeongyang. If you haven't seen the pictures of it online, check them out: the architecture is very futuristic and EPCOT-esque. At first it felt weirdly empty and I was afraid it'd be like those Chinese cities that don't have anyone actually living in them. But I found that it has plenty of lively public spaces.
* The train to Karaganda was hot and 2 hours late, but it was also very cheap, so I won't complain too much.
* I had no expectations of Karaganda and I did minimal research about it beforehand. It just seemed like a convenient stop between the two major cities. With that said, it was a very charming city of half a million people. It had beautiful walkways that went around the city, and its central park is massive. The park offers a bunch of activities (boat rides, carnival rides, gym equipment, soccer games), and it comes alive at night with street performers and whatnot.
* If you're going to ride 14 hours across Kazakhstan in a train, spend the little extra for a bed. Don't be like me.
* There aren't many car rental services in Kazakhstan. With that said, the one I used in Almaty was helpful. I rented a car from them for only a day and a half to see the southeast of the country, which is beautiful and well worth the trip alone. In addition to Charyn Canyon and Kolsai Lake, there were plenty of scenic shots along the way, including other canyons. The whole area just seemed otherworldly. I wish I could've seen Altyn Emel National Park as well, but sadly I wasn't allowed to bring the small car I rented to drive on those roads, and I couldn't find a vehicle large enough to do so. Oh well, next time.
* Almaty is one of my favorite cities on Earth. You can take a bus from it to Ile-Alatau National Park, which has some of the most difficult hiking I've ever done. But even within the city, there's something to see around every corner. I was in the city for nearly a week and I felt like I had hardly seen any of it. There were just so many parks, trails, and random city blocks that were worth stumbling upon. Also, I found an adorable Kazakh squirrel that kept me amused for 20 minutes.
* The people of Kazakhstan are extremely friendly. Unfortunately I only know a few words of Russian and Kazakh, and few people there speak English, but the people I did speak to were excited to tell me about their country.
* I started playing Pokemon Go recently (in the year of our lord 2024) and it was pretty fun to play Pokemon Go in Kazakhstan, during the less busy days.
* You should definitely visit Kazakhstan if you can! I don't see it talked about enough here.

Hi,

A relative of mine died yesterday in Turkey. I tried calling the State Department's emergency line and tried every single possible menu option (I avoided the obvious wrong options, like human trafficking). They all end up being a recorded message providing me information I could already read online, or directed me to travel.state.gov.

Is there any way I can reach any emergency consular service that's not a recorded message?

I also tried the US Embassy in Ankara ‚Äî also closed and they advised only to use a certain number for current ongoing emergency. She already died so it's not really an ongoing emergency. Not sure if I should still try that number.

1f5wkxw,Mistaken Identity gets me Amazing Service,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f5wkxw/mistaken_identity_gets_me_amazing_service/,784,"This happened a while back

So I am a Freelance operations consultant and have worked with a number of different industries. This story takes place when I was working for an Airline after a friend of mine in there got me a connection for the project.

Since this was a 9+ month project I had to get a significant amount of access and clearance for this project as it was highly involved and on site at one of their facilities. I got an Airline Badge, Two City Badges, a TWIC Badge, and A Security Badge. I had to keep them visible almost all the time so I had a noisy and large  lanyard. I was also allowed to to use the work travel function (which is different from regular employee standby I guess never fully understood it) because I was not just working in the local city I am based out of. 

My buddy informed me to dress professionally since it was work travel for the airline and I followed suit. On my first time traveling to the project city I was dressed very well, had all my badges, and my work planner/journal. I take notes a lot on the go a lot so I take notes almost everywhere I go. I was standing by the my gate while taking notes when I was approached by the Customer Service Agent. She asked ‚ÄúAre you OP?‚Äù shocked she who knew I said ‚ÄúYes, how can I help you?‚Äù She then replied ‚ÄúWe had an opening in first class and wanted to let you know you switched your seat, also the crew is about to board if you would like to board with them.‚Äù Confused but excited at the upgrade I said sure.

I saw the agent talking to the Captain before I boarded but didn‚Äôt think much of it as the time. I got seated and was still scribbling my plans and items I needed in my note book. The flight attendants made some small talk with me, offered me a drink, and were very nice compared to other flights I had been on. I was chocking this up to being in first class so again didn‚Äôt think much of it. When the pilots had finished their pre-boarding checks they came up to me and started chatting as well. I defiantly getting confused now as I know this would never happen on a normal flight so right before they left I asked the captain privately what was going on. He said ‚ÄúAre you not an auditor?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúNo I was just traveling to a project in CITY HERE, is that why everyone was asking so strange?‚Äù. The captain he told me I showed as a VIP in the system but nothing filled in as what so they thought I was a auditor or an executive for the company, he looked back and told me not to say anything and enjoy the extra service while laughing and heading back to the cockpit.

The rest of the flight I received some of the best customer service I had on a flight and maybe have enjoyed an extra drink or two. Needless to say it was a perfect flight.

TL;DR Today I got an upgrade and the best service ever for not explaining why I was traveling",41,2024-08-31 15:23:29,undercover_union145,0.97

Day before yesterday had taken a train to Naples and from Naples to Pompiee. Had a wonderful time. Returned back to Naples, enjoyed a pizza, on the way back to the train station just casually checked my hand to notice that my gold bracelet was missing .

 I recently got married and it was a gift from my grandparents . They wanted me to always wear it. Looks like at some point the bracelet just fell. I have a picture from the time i boarded the train from Rome to Naples where I was wearing it. Post that due to my huge jacket it‚Äôs difficult to see.

Since the past 36 hours I‚Äôm just replaying where it could‚Äôve fallen , what can I do. But I know it‚Äôs just lost and nothing can be done. It was worth a 1000$ and the guilt of wearing it and losing it is bearing hard on me . 

I‚Äôm just on day 5 of my trip , don‚Äôt want this experience to sour the remaining 15 days .

Good lesson learned though . Don‚Äôt travel with valuables :/

Edit:
Thank you for your kind words. I might‚Äôve lost a bracelet but gained priceless insight into the lives and loss of so many wonderful internet strangers. Thanks for sharing your experiences. Addressing a few things:

1. I don‚Äôt think my travel insurance covers loss of personal belongings. So I don‚Äôt think the financial loss is recoverable. Which is fine, it could be worse.

[Travel insurance coverage](https://imgur.com/f9pPE1p)

2. I‚Äôve currently not informed my family about it. I know they won‚Äôt be upset at me but it‚Äôll make them very sad . I‚Äôd rather they not feel the sadness that I felt.

3. I got multiple suggestions to file a police complaint.
I‚Äôm currently in Florence. Does anyone know if I can file the complaint here? Or does it have to be in Rome/ Naples

4. I‚Äôve dropped an email to Pompei incase something turns up in their lost and found ( unable to reach them On their number)

5. Checked Trenitalia‚Äôs online lost and found ,No luck .

6. Tried calling the pizza place, number is switched off 

7. I think I was so careful about my wallet and cellphone that I got distracted from the bracelet. It‚Äôs okay, sh!t happens. Will treat this as a 1000$ lesson that‚Äôll probably save me more money in the future. I‚Äôm enjoying my time here. My loving husband has been trying to buy me jewellery in Florence to maybe replace my loss. Though I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm up for anymore jewellery for some time ;)

It was probably stolen from my hand. Though I‚Äôd like to believe that it was lost in the ancient streets of Pompei, and years from now, covered in dust and buried in rubble, it‚Äôll make a budding archaeologist very happy momentarily ",234,2023-12-18 03:41:58,Top_Belt_8065,0.91

To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email‚Äîabsolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn‚Äôt know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com‚Äôs customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I‚Äôm still waiting. I‚Äôve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can‚Äôt reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I‚Äôve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it‚Äôs clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn‚Äôt exist. And what‚Äôs worse‚ÄîBooking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It‚Äôs been **two months**‚Äîhow long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you‚Äôre looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com.

We visited quite a few places and traditional villages, but the places shown here are:
Watubela Beach
Weekacura Waterfall
Weemanemba Lagoon
Lendonagara Hills

If you're up for an adventure, make sure to visit Sumba before it's being overran by tourists.
It is only a 1hr40min plane ride from Bali, so easily accessible once you're in Bali.

The hotel we stayed at is called Maringi Sumba Hotel, which is actually a foundation. Each year, the foundation selects a few students for their hospitality program. The students are trained to work in 5 star hotels and on cruise ships across the world. So the hotel's staff are these students, which gives it a very special atmosphere.

Yes, the quality was decreasing in the last years. 

But now. I've read the Spain new guide. I don't know where to start to describe what a monstrosity it's. Full of color photos. Contributions by some Instagram celebrities. Text without a logic flow. No practical information about opening hours, admission prices, nothing. More like general descriptions that appears a synthesis of low quality information. 

The Prado museum is described in just few lines, no map, no indication about the rooms, just a general text. 

And the text is now in just one large column. With a lot of white space. 

I was so shocked that, believe me, I've taken the book from the shelf, read some pages, put it back in disbelief, and then repeating this several times. I am considering to buy the current versions of possible destinations in the future, to have some support before they disappear.

Sure there were some hiccups here and there, some long lines and such but nothing unusual. But Istanbul airport really pissed me off for some reason.

I walked like more than a kilometre just to get a toilet and it was broken, walked more to reach another where there was a long queue for men (I have seen queues in women toilets but rarely for men) and this was the Gate sections. The design of the airport is surely made to make you walk A LOT to go to your gates, pass through their shitty shops so that they can sell you their shitty trinkets. Other airports have this too, but Istanbul seemed like selling these trinkets was their primary task, and not the flights.

Coming from Helsinki airport which probably was the best airport in Europe in terms of ease of access, cleanliness, fast Wi-Fi, Right amount of shops; Istanbul made me feel like I'm thrown back to dark ages.

EDIT: Totally forgot to mention the Wi-Fi shit. I had no network covereage and they needed OTP send to your phone to use the airport Wi-Fi, like dude? Or you queue outside the Kiosk to get the password to use Wi-Fi for an hour. Why make the life of a traveller so difficult? In all other airports in Europe, the Wi-Fi was just simple open to connect.

I understand that Istanbul is big and busy airport but i still believe that the design is bad and built like a vanity project, like the architect forgot that the primary task was to get people on the flights. ",852,2024-08-14 13:47:19,Aggressive-Banan-325,0.82

I'm 40, a single father, my son joined the Army making me an empty nester.  I resigned from my job a couple of months ago, and I am 30-45 days away from being able to cut away and disappear for a while.

I plan to not have much of a plan - I want to take a suitcase, my golf clubs and a passport and just... go for a while.  I've budgeted $100k for a year of travel and intend to see the world until I get bored or run out of money, whichever comes first.

I have never taken a true vacation before; the reality of what I'm about to do (and my lack of experience) is settling on me. What am I not thinking of that could make this go poorly? What \*should\* be planned? Is bringing my golf clubs dumb?

In my brain I envision something like this:  Go to SE Asia first, Vietnam and Thailand I'd like to visit.  I don't know how long I'll stay, but I'm confident I can find a place to stay that's decent and stretches my budget. From there, I really want to learn how to scuba dive in New Zealand and see Poor Knights(edit).  I've never been to Europe so if after those two stops I'm still hungry for more I figure I'll just start in Portugal and work my way up to Berlin for what I hear is a great place to go dancing.

I'm not married to any ideas. I love EDM, I want to go dance and see the world and have fun for a while with no responsibilities or obligations - meet new people, figure out who the hell I am, y'know that kind of stuff.

I've fantasized about this moment for a very long time. I am equally excited and terrified. If you were in my shoes, what kinds of things are you doing to ensure this year goes smoothly?

EDIT:  Golf clubs are out, I was on the fence there thanks all lol

EDIT2: Thank you everyone for the advice!  I did go to REI to try on a backpack and got overwhelmed. They put a bunch of weights in a 65+10 Osprey and it was worse than any rucksack I ever carried lol. I'm thinking a large duffel bag with backstraps is probably cool, and I'll just adapt on the fly for things I need.

Europe first vs. SEA first, I'm not sure. I'll think on this as I get my house ready for rent. Europe feels like a budget sink and that's why I wanted to leave it for last; I didn't think I would have trouble with language or culture in SEA. These are the reasons I chose SEA as the starting point (plus proximity to NZ. I visited Sydney when I was in the Army, but I owe Melbourne it's due yet)

Figure out my phone plan ahead of time (I was just gonna roam and keep my AT&amp;T plan). 

I will definitely get my 'jabs' (new slang lfg), my passport is good for many years, I'll find some good travel insurance (never heard of or considered this, thanks all), Barcelona &gt; Berlin for my dance vibe ;)

The first time she skipped me, served others around me and then circled back; the second time she didn‚Äôt serve me at all‚Äîshe served everyone else in first class‚Ä¶ then with 20 minutes left in the flight she asked me ‚ÄúOh did you want anything to drink?‚Äù. At that point I just told her no.

Other people that she served before me, she told them ‚ÄúThanks for being a loyal customer.‚Äù

I‚Äôm trying to understand is there an order to how first class gets serviced? Or was she blatantly being rude?

She literally took the drink order of the person in the same row as me (I had the aisle seat, he had the window) but skipped me.


ETA:
Thanks everyone for the responses. It‚Äôs helpful to get a POV and I appreciate the kindness shown. A few people have asked similar questions, so I‚Äôm editing to answer some of the big ones:

- I bought the ticket for first class (I wasn‚Äôt moved there due to special points or no space, etc.)

- I wasn‚Äôt asleep nor did I have headphones in to look unapproachable. Nor did I look inebriated.

- I spoke and smiled to her on the plane (no reason I could have offended her).

- I wasn‚Äôt dressed as a slob.

- There‚Äôs no chance I looked like I was a couple with the person next to me

- I am an African American woman

- She didn‚Äôt seem to be doing a special order of service, she just skipped me. She started at the front (my row) by taking the drink order of the person in the same row as me (I had the aisle seat, he had the window) but skipped me and then took the order of the person on the same row but across the aisle. And then moved on to the rows behind me.

- Why didn‚Äôt I just speak up? Hard to explain but the timing was not long enough for me to open my mouth before she asked everyone else for their order. 

- Should I have been more assertive? In hindsight, absolutely. I should have been. But at the time I was embarrassed to ask just in case I just didn‚Äôt understand the way things worked. I‚Äôm human and can admit that sometimes you just feel insecure in a situation‚Äîthis was one of those times.

It was a small plane, she was the only flight attendant in my section... there were no other attendants to ask.

I didn't talk to a service member at the arrival gate desk because I was more concerned with quickly grabbing my bag from baggage claim and calling my husband that I hadn't seen in several days to excitedly tell him I had landed and couldn't wait to see him.

As I settled down, I thought more and more about how much this bothered me...

- I like Paris! Then again I grew up going to it, so I didn't have an overly romantisised view of it. Also, if you spent a grand total of two or three days and spent one at Disneyland you don't actually have any idea what Paris is like 

- Rome is far dirtier and more touristy ( to the point you have to pre book pretty much everything)than Paris but does not get the hate.

- I like Warsaw way more than Krakow ( full disclosure, I live in Krakow ). 

- Berlin is overrated as a travel destination. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, it seems like a great place to live, but it reminded me of many other cities I've been to. Also, the clubbing scene is super over rated and kinda cringe, not for anyone who likes being spontaneous and not trying super hard to look like you are not trying. 

- Brazil sells itself very wrong. People have this view of it as a crazy party destination,when it's only ok in this regard. It is absolutely incredible destination for nature, culture and history and I wish tourists would engage more with that.

- The best parties and festivals are in the Balkans. The locals are amazing too!

- Spain is my favourite country but I like Barcelona the least. 

- In the topic of Spain, the is so much more to Ibiza and Mallorca than partying.

- I had a really great time in Milwaukee and would go back.

- I am biased because I'm Australian, but I honestly haven't seen better beaches anywhere. Just as good, yes, but not better.

1gnvx4z,"Argentina‚Ä¶..MEH!
",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gnvx4z/argentinameh/,743,"After reading a recent thread about how wonderful Argentina is, my thoughts after visiting last month. 

I was a couple of weeks and visited Buenos Aires, Bariloche, El Calafate, Ushuaia and Iguaz√∫. From best to worst: 

Iguaz√∫: the falls are really astonishing.

Ushuaia: very interesting, unique place

El Calafate (Perito Moreno): definitely worth it but for some reason the glacier wasn't that wow feeling I had in Iguaz√∫

Bariloche: rented a car. Cool place but honestly you can see the same stuff or better in some parts in Europe or North America (Alps, Rocky mountains, etc)

Buenos Aires: ran down hole. I spent three days and there were too many. Unsafe, uber expensive, for a big city there are plenty more interesting in Europe and even North America. 

Now the bad things:

**- Safety:** Argentina is NOT a safe country. Buenos Aires is not a safe city despite how locals will try to convince you. Whoever says ""central Buenos Aires is like New York/Miami/London/Paris"" is in complete denial.

I never left premium areas (Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, Belgrano, Microcentro, etc.) and you could see people (locals!) looking around while using their phones. Or whenever I walked down the street, if I ""overtook"" another person on a walkway, he or she will look back to check that I was not ""safety threat"". Many people with their backpacks on the front.

I took Ubers back and forth to La Boca and the areas around where complete slums. I wouldn't have liked my Uber broke down there. xD

On the other hand for instance Ushuaia felt safe. But Ushuaia is a small town isolated from the world.

**- Prices:** I was not expecting Argentina to be cheap but it is a complete joke now. Prices make no logic. The dollar blue (more convenient) is now roughly 10% more convenient than the official rate. So it was not about me exchanging dollars in the wrong places. 

  
Just an example. The Prison in Ushuaia (a small local museum) was 36.700 ARS in September (maybe the prices have been increased because inflation and the website is not updated)

[https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen](https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen)

That means that in the ""dollar blue"" (the unofficial more favorable exchange), it is 32 USD

[https://cuex.com/en/ars\_pa-usd](https://cuex.com/en/ars_pa-usd)

The Louvre museum (they recently increased prices) is 22 EUR. Or 23 USD

[https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission](https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission)

So a small museum in Ushuaia is more expensive than the Louvre.

The minitrekking in Perito Moreno (walking in the glacier) is now 480,000 ARS + 45,000 ARS for the entrance to the park (compulsory). So a total of 525,000 ARS or (!) 466 USD just for walking in the glacier (with a group) for about 2 hours. It is nice but nothing really glamourous or private. Just a typical group being taken from left to right on big buses then big boat then big group walking the glacier. 

[https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/](https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/)

I have been quite a few times in Switzerland and once in Norway and I never felt that ""ripped off"". At least Switzerland/Norway are top notch, clean, wealthy countries, but no offence Argentina is at best a ""second world"" country. So you are paying those prices in quite a dysfunctional environment.

**- Inconvenience:** 

Argentina is quite a dysfunctional country so expect inconvenience. For instance, flights. I paid a fortune for domestic flights (I flew Aerol√≠neas and flyBondi) and I had a few big delays. I could see on the screens plenty of cancelled flights. And right now (as of November 10, 2024) there are strikes that leave airports closed. So good luck if you are stranded in Ushuaia which is like 3,000 km to Buenos Aires which itself is like 10,000 km to the US or Europe. 

My advice is that Argentina is not worth the visit right now. 

Prices are completely out of control. The inflation stuff changes all the time, so maybe booking a holiday 3 months from now means that in January (for instance) prices will be 30% more expensive (or cheaper). 

There are a lot of social issues (I remember - I read Spanish -) reading in the newspapers in the street that 52% of Argentinians live below the poverty line. That means strikes, crime, etc. that can affect you directly or indirectly.

Just wait for things to calm and it might be worth to visit. Skip Buenos Aires (just one day max to check it out) and venture into the nature that is worth visiting.

How do I make it stop?",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e3ixh2/stopped_randomly_nearly_every_time_since_2017_i/,730,"In 2017, I took a trip from SFO to Miami for work. Due to the camera and audio equipment I was traveling with, I ended up checking three bags. I had some uncertainty about my travel schedule, so I booked refundable tickets. I changed my flight from SFO to Miami on the day of, at no cost to me.  

On my return trip from MIA to SFO, I was stopped by a Department of Homeland Security agent at the gate boarding my flight.  Only I was stopped out of everyone boarding the flight.  I was asked to take off my backpack, and many questions were asked of me.  I was asked how much money I had on me, if I had marijuana on me, and why I was in Miami for 10 days.  I didn't have any cash or marijuana and I was traveling for work.  The last question that they asked me was if they could search me and all my (3) checked bags.  I said yes, that they could.  They told me I was free to go. I was very polite with them and I went home safely, but I was spooked. 

Keep in mind I have TSA-pre and Global entry. From that point on, for 4 years, I could not print out boarding passes or luggage tags from the kiosks.  Every time I travel, I am ‚Äúrandomly selected‚Äù for additional screening. I filed for a redress number in 2022 and then I was able to print out my boarding passes but still had issues with luggage.  Sometime in 2023, the luggage tags started printing, but maybe 1 out of 8 times I cannot print my luggage. Mind you this is with the redress number. I always find these white pieces of paper in my luggage with the TSA logo on them which says they opened and searched my bag.

Every time I fly domestically within the USA for 7 years, despite adding my TSA pre number and now my redress number to all my reservations, I have been randomly selected for additional screening.  I fly 20-40 times per year and I still have TSA pre. 

One of the strangest things that happened to me was that during one of the instances that I could not print out my luggage tags or bag tags, I was flying back home to SFO from (a city that I will keep confidential to conceal my identity) within the USA. I was able to check my bag, but while I was waiting in the TSA line, there was 6 different Department of Homeland Security agents all with dogs roaming around.  Out of the several hundred people in line, I was selected again for additional screening, and one of the 6 dogs was instructed to sniff my belongings.  I watched for about 20 minutes to see if anyone else has been selected to have a dog sniff their bags and they did not.

Things to consider: I am a white male. I inadvertently upset someone who is in a relationship with a DHS agent around 2017, the same time all of this started happening. I have never been arrested or convicted of a crime. 

I am wondering if there was some retribution going on here that I was added to some extra screening list?  

Several months ago I wrote to the Department of Homeland Security asking them to please investigate my case and I named the individual who I believe may have added me out of malicious intent.  Since then nothing has changed and I got a letter saying ‚Äúwe cannot confirm nor deny that you are on any list and we cannot disclose the results of our investigation‚Äù blah blah blah.

As of July 14th, the day of this writing, I still get stopped every single time, to the point where I know that it is not random.  It‚Äôs been over 100 times in 7 years. 

I want this to stop and I do not know what else to do at this point.  It is not fun being treated like a criminal or a terrorist when I have done nothing wrong.  

Edit July 14th, 2024: I am blown away by the responses, thank you so much!  To clarify I am a US Citizen and it is highly unlikely that a criminal or terrorist has my name.  If I mentioned my name, you would understand why immediately. My current plan is to write a letter to my representatives and to contact an attorney to see if I have legal recourse. 

Update July 17th, 2024: Response from DHS: ‚ÄúDHS TRIP can neither confirm nor deny any information about you which may be within federal watchlists or reveal any law enforcement sensitive information. We have found that about 2% of the DHS TRIP complainants actually have some connection to the Terrorist Watchlist. Complaints most often arise either because the traveler‚Äôs name and personal information is similar to the name and personal information of another person in systems which contain information from Federal, state, local and foreign sources or because the traveler has been delayed in travel for reasons unrelated to such data, such as by random screening. The U.S. Government has completed our review of your case. Your experience was most likely caused by a misidentification against a government record or by random selection. We regret any inconvenience that you may have experienced and, where appropriate, have made updates to our records that may assist in avoiding future incident of misidentification.‚Äù",123,2024-07-14 20:44:00,Dramatic-Praline1687,0.94

I've just finished a month long trip to Albania and Greece and decided it would be a good idea to share my thoughts. Hopefully this post can help someone else travelling there soon. I've already posted my Albania and Greece, Part 1 report. I travelled solo, carry on only and used public transportation everywhere.


(Pics 1&amp;2 are Sifnos, 3 is Sarakiniko, 4 is Blue Bay, 5 is Klima) 


**Sifnos**
 
Well I jinxed myself. After having a great run with the ferries my trip to Sifnos was anything but. Woke up to a terribly windy day with no improvement in sight. My ferry was delayed by 45 minutes because of this, however the communication from Seajets was great - text messages and emails with the new departure time. 


Overall, I don't like boats and I don't like planes - something I've very much had to get over as an Australian who loves to travel. So I was quite anxious about this ferry trip. 


It was a rough and bumpy four hours and I arrived in the dark, an hour later than expected. My ferry also went Naxos-Paros-Mykonos-Paros-Sifnos (then on to Milos). If I'd known there were going to be two stops in Paros I would've bought two separate tickets and avoided the Mykonos section but you live and learn! Definitely check the route the ferry is taking whenever you're booking your island hopping.


About halfway to Paros (the first time), I remembered I had a very old, probably expired, sea-sickness/anti-nausea tablet in my wallet. I didn't feel sick but I took it anyway just in case, and I felt fine throughout the journey. A couple of people got sick about 10 mins out from Sifnos so I was VERY glad to get off the ship.


A side note about transportation in Sifnos - the public bus network is quite good, although was winding down for the season. The timetables are easy to find online. I knew I would have to get a taxi to my accommodation due to when I was arriving. There are 10 taxis on the island. If you want to take a taxi, I would recommend calling the day before and booking one. If you google taxis Sifnos you will find the phone numbers. My hotel in Naxos was kind enough to call and book for me. I had taxi no. 9 and the driver was great! He pointed out where the bus stops were in Apollonia depending on your destination, the road to Artemonas, and the walking path to take to Kastro to avoid the road a bit. 


The difficult journey was, however, worth the destination. I stayed in Kastro, right above the Church of the Seven Martyrs and it was a slice of heaven. I highly recommend coming to the Church or the trail above at sunrise or sunset. As you can see from my photos, it's spectacular. 


Everyday consisted of a wander down a rocky stairway to a tiny sliver of beach or concrete platform for sunbaking and swimming. I also walked to Apollonia and wandered around. This takes about 45mins and is slightly uphill. It's nothing too strenuous but take plenty of water and wear sunscreen if you're doing it in the summer as there's no shade. There's also buses available but I just walked. 


I had plans to do some hiking to other beaches but in the end, it was still quite warm, I had underestimated just how hilly Sifnos was and I really liked my concrete platform so I hardly left Kastro. 


Sifnos is definitely the quietest island I went to, and was well on its way to the end of the season. I loved it though, it was exactly what I needed after the overstimulation of Naxos. 


I stayed in an AirBnB - Song of the Sea. Five stars absolutely. 


**Milos**

After a quick 45 mins ferry journey, I arrived in Milos. I stayed in Pollonia which is about 20 mins from the Port (Adamas/Adamantas). I arrived about midday, so that afternoon I jumped on a couple of buses and headed south to Fyriplaka beach. Milos has quite a dramatic landscape and Fyriplaka was no exception. Soft, white sand, turquoise water and sheer cliffs surrounding. It was a great spot to while away a few hours. 


The next day I caught the bus to Sarakiniko Beach. This place is unlike anywhere I've ever been. I'd seen pictures but it truly is a lunar landscape. A lot of people don't rate the swimming/beach here, but I really like rock/pebble beaches so I really enjoyed just perching on a rock and going for the occasional dip. It was still quite busy but plenty of room on the rocks for everyone to spread out. A lot of people seem to just come here for pictures and then leave so it never felt overwhelmingly busy. 


After Sarakiniko, I decided I would do to Plaka/Trypiti/Klima so caught the bus back to Adamas. The bus to Trypiti wasn't leaving for another hour so I decided to hike there instead. It's about 3.5km to Klima and took about 45 mins. It's slightly up hill at the start but then flat and downhill. It's not hard, but there's no shade so bring a hat, water and sunscreen. It's a gravel road, so there will be cars occasionally. I had two cars pass me and both drivers stopped to ask if I was ok or needed a lift which I thought was very friendly. Once you arrive at the Panorama Hotel at the top of Klima, there's a walking path to the left that will take you down to the water. 


Klima is a very sweet, pretty little village with the famous colourful Syrma fishermen houses. There's only a souvenir shop and one restaurant here. I was really keen to eat at the restaurant as it's highly recommended but it was closed for a private event the day I was there. I was starving by this point but the only option was the 25 min walk uphill to Trypiti or onwards to Plaka. I walked all the way to Plaka, then had a late lunch in Trypiti before catching the bus back. 


The following morning was an earlyish rise to get to the port for a boat tour. I was originally booked with Polco sailing but they had to cancel my tour due to technical difficulties with the boat. This left me scrambling the day before to find a new tour and luckily Sailing Milos had one spot left! It was an excellent tour and all the crew were so friendly. 


It was the full round of Milos with Poliegos and it was incredible. Highly recommend doing a boat tour if you go to Milos as there's so many swimming spots that are only accessible by boat. The colour of the Blue Bay was unlike anything I'd seen before. I purposely didn't look up photos beforehand so I would be awed when I arrived and it was amazing. 


My advice would be to not leave your boat tour to the last day of your trip like I did. I knew when I booked that I was running the gauntlet between weather or other issues causing a cancellation, I was just incredibly lucky that I could squeeze onto another tour.


Like elsewhere, I relied on the bus to get around and it was fine! A lot of people said you can't experience Milos without a car, but I saw everything I wanted to see in the time I had, and the bus network is quite far reaching. The timetables don't quite match up so sometimes there was a wait for the next bus but I'm on holidays so what's the rush. Tickets cost ‚Ç¨2 and you pay the driver when you exit the bus (cash only). 


Now that I've done this trip, I sort of wish I'd done the islands in the opposite order for a couple of reasons:

1. Koufonisi is just such a special place and it would've been an extra special end to the trip to finish there. But that's just a small thing in the big scheme of things and I loved my trip regardless.

2. By the end of the trip I was quite tired and Koufonisi would've been great for this as it's so small and walkable. Just walk for a kilometre and flop on a beach for the day.  


Overall, I loved my trip and I'm excited to come back and visit more islands, especially returning to Koufonisi. I definitely plan on sticking to smaller, quieter islands. I've already added Donousa, Paxos/Antipaxos and Kefalonia to my list. So any suggestions let me know!

185ukyb,We just got scammed in Manila,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/185ukyb/we_just_got_scammed_in_manila/,718,"‚Ä¶and we feel like idiots. My boyfriend and I have been travelling for the last 5 months. We have travelled all over Europe (including the Balkans) in our camper van and now we have spent 2 months in Hongkong, Vietnam and Thailand. We feel like we never got scammed. Sure, we have paid tourist prices sometimes but we are ok with that as it was always reasonable. We both have travelled quiet a bit before all that so we really don‚Äòt know how we made such a mistake.

So today we flew from Bangkok to Manila, arriving at Gate 3. We have a connecting flight to Cebu and the airport staff tells us we need to go through immigration, pick up our luggage, go to Gate 2 and check our luggage back in. It also means we have to go through the entire security process again.

Fine, we thought we have plenty of time (about 2.5 hours all together), until the passport queue is about 200 meters long. We slowly get nervous. Afterwards, we pick up our luggage and we have no clue how to get to gate 2. We ask the airport staff and they say we need to take the bus or a taxi to the gate. Also, she said we should hurry up because we were quiet late for the connecting flight already.

Fine, we go outside, the bus station is nowhere to be seen, but there are taxis. We asked how long of a drive it is, the taxi driver said 5-10 minutes. And yes, we were stressed, tired and dumb and just got into the taxi without asking about the price. It can‚Äôt be that much right? Note we also don‚Äòt have a phillippine SIM card yet to just call a grab.

So the driver takes off and there was another guy sitting in the passenger seat. I read afterwards that this should have been another warning sign. After 2-3 minutes we find a laminated paper hidden in the back seat. It is a price list and it says it costs 12‚Äò000 pesos (!) (around 180 Euros) for a ride from gate 3 to gate 2. 

We then ask the driver about the price and he confirms the price of 12‚Äò000 pesos. We tell him no and to bring us back to our departure gate as there is no way we pay such amount and we‚Äòd rather miss our connecting flight. 
We also say we don‚Äòt even have money except some remaining Thai Bath. He then confirms to bring us back to gate 3 but that we will miss our flight. We say we don‚Äòt care. Both of the guys then start harassing us about how much Thai Bath we got. We started to feel uncomfortable, in a country we don‚Äòt know, no phone connection and all our belongings in the car.

We then tell them we pay 2000 thai bath (around 50 Euros) for them to bring us to the gate. The guy starts driving like a complete maniac and tells us to give the money right now. We tell him he won‚Äòt get anything until we get to the gate and our backpacks out of the trunk. 

We give them the money there and they take off. Honestly, we are just happy we are ok and still got all of our valuables. We are not getting intimidated quickly but we felt like this situation could have escalated badly. 

Go ahead and make fun of us‚Ä¶ üòÅ I hope the rest of our stay in the Philippines will be a bit more fun!",274,2023-11-28 06:10:36,Keris_91,0.9

1be414g,Rethinking using Booking.com again - they removed my legitimate negative review which tells me their reviews are gamed,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1be414g/rethinking_using_bookingcom_again_they_removed_my/,720,"A few months back, I shared an underwhelming experience I had at a place in Taormina, Italy, which you can find here: https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/la-bergerie.html. 

I won't dive into all the details again, but in summary, the images were highly deceptive. The only way to catch a glimpse of the view was to stand and lean out from the balcony. Both the building and the rooms were a bit run down. As for the breakfast, it was a disappointment, offering a meager serving of a runny egg, some bread, and a handful of fruit.

After much contemplation, I decided to leave a negative review of 4 our of 10, especially considering the over $300 per night rate for what felt like a dilapidated establishment. For comparison I checked other rates in the area and we had traveled around Italy for 2 weeks.

Our choice to stay there was influenced by the misleading photos and reviews, even though there were several other options at nearly half the price.  And the beautiful view of Isola la Bella shown in the pics also was a factor.

My review was composed with professionalism and restraint, merely pointing out that the images did not accurately reflect the property and the breakfast certainly did not justify an additional ‚Ç¨20.

Subsequently, the host contacted me via WhatsApp, imploring me to delete my review. I blocked her and reported the incident to Booking.com, who assured me that they would address the issue with the host. However, I received no further updates.

Recently, my thoughts revisited this ordeal, prompting me to check the listing again, only to discover that while my rating remains visible, the written content of my review has been removed, replaced with a message stating it was hidden for not adhering to their guidelines.

This incident underscores the unreliability of Booking.com reviews and serves as a cautionary tale.  They clearly remove bad reviews and push up the good ones.  In fact, when looking at places and seeing the reviews in the sidebar one never sees a negative review.  One has to select ""see all reviews"" and then sort by lowest.

Booking.com, like many other corporations, is a morally bankrupt, scam of a service.  Late stage capitalism at it's finest.",124,2024-03-13 16:54:00,Sufficient_Repairs_,0.94
1bl4q18,My impression after 2 weeks in India (first trip),https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bl4q18/my_impression_after_2_weeks_in_india_first_trip/,718,"After a lot of preparation my friend and I (both female) left for India last month. We were nervous. We really love Indian food and our Indian friends in Europe were incredibly kind so despite many of our friends asking why we were travelling to India we went anyway. It was really a whirlwind of a trip. There were many things that amazed me but also things that disturbed me. Overall my impression of India improved starkly and I'd advertise it to anyone who would listen. 

The highs:
- incredible hospitality 
- incredible food
- traditional arts are really great, i am not the type to buy things when travelling except for fridge magnets but i ended up paying hundreds of euros for indian crafts because i was so impressed by them and the skills of the salesmen
- breathtaking buildings (Taj Mahal, those in Jaipur and places of worship in Delhi). Honestly from pictures Hindu temples always look a bit too much to me, but they looked much better close-up. You could see the Intricate carvings and details.

The lows:
- traffic and incessant honking 
- street children. It felt very wrong when our tour guides and drivers were yes mam no mam to us and shooing away the street children
- people in India telling us about how their religions regard everyone as equal whereas it was probably the most unequal place I've been to
- seeing photos of Modi everywhere, he felt like Big Brother
- our very deferential tour guides telling us their wives were not allowed to leave home as if that were something normal
- tourists paying 10 times the price locals pay for entrance fees
- everyone expecting a tip

The surprises:
- no it's not the cleanest place but no where near the level the news would have you believe 
- i was worried there would be men following us for no reason which would creep me out but i was pleasantly surprised to find no one actually paid much attention to us, it made me feel safer
- how nice Delhi Metro is
- how green Delhi is
- how many animals can be found in the city and they seemed to coexist excellently with humans

Sadly upon returning i saw disturbing news coming out of India again. I remember at times feeling resentful of Indian men who made the country unsafe for women which is why we couldn't just hang out by ourselves and we always needed to go out together. We travel together a lot and usually have solo days to just wander around but we decided against it in India and it was overwhelming for me at times.

1f7u73q,Someone else received my boarding pass,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f7u73q/someone_else_received_my_boarding_pass/,719,"Yesterday I had a flight with KLM; checked in online the evening before. I went to the airport, through security with my boarding pass (digital, didn't print it at the airport). When boarding started my pass gets rejected at the scanner. I walk over to the gate desk, scan it there and the displays says 'You are already boarded'. So the employee behind the desk was like ""oh weird, maybe it still did register, just go on"".

I enter the plane and surprise, someone is already sitting on my seat. So I ask him whether he is in the correct seat. He shows me his printed boarding pass and indeed it's the same seat, but I also notice my name is on his pass (he hadn't noticed). Ended up being a whole discussion between KLM staff and airport staff, which took like half an hour on an already delayed flight. Eventually he got kicked off the flight and I got my seat. During the flight I asked the staff what the hell that was all about, but they didn't really know either.

Anyone else ever experienced anything like this? How can you get a boarding pass with a different name? For both the self-service or check-in desk you would need to show your ID/passport. I assume the check-in desk maybe made a mistake. Since it was a flight within the Schengen area there was no need to show your ID at customs and your ID wasn't checked at boarding either, so it could go unnoticed for quite a while. Glad I still got home by this flight, but this seems like either a security or data (gdpr) breach/violation at KLM or the airport. Do I need to take any further action on this?

Edit: based on your advice I escalated this to KLM. Will provide more info when I get a reply.

Edit 2: got a reply with some apologies and that they will look into into their process. Didn't get an answer on the 'how', but I bet they don't know themselves (yet) either. I hope they will do something with it to prevent it in the future.",178,2024-09-03 02:46:18,Taggerino,0.97

They were not expensive, not cheap, reasonably priced. I thought ""I'll see some equally nice magnets somewhere else later"". I didn't. All souvenir shops in the town had same, ugly, cliche magnets. Dubai Frame's souvenir shop is only accessible when you go down the observation deck.

When I went to Japan, I wanted to get myself some tableware like plates, bowls, etc. I held back when I saw some stores in touristy areas. I told myself I'll go to the flea market and get better stuff for a cheaper price. Well, joke on me, went to the flea market on my last day to be greeted by security guard telling me it's cancelled due to rain (I had no idea they cancel when it's raining). I'd much rather end up with slightly overpriced tableware that would take me back to Japan every time I use it, than no tableware at all.

The message I have, is that if you really like something and there's a chance you won't be able to come back to that place - buy it. Worst that can happen is that you'll find that thing a $1 or 2 cheaper somewhere else. Getting a suboptimal deal is worth a souvenir that will be a gateway to good memories from your trip.",82,2024-03-13 13:37:52,wigglepizza,0.93

I understand that everything is more expensive now, but for christ sake how can people go to Rome now without being crazy rich?

I have enough money to travel, but some country are now completly off my list for now for this reason. I can't seem to find anything in Barcelona, Rome or Berlin that's not north of 200$ for a terrible sketchy room. 

Even hostels now are crazy expensive for a single room.  I don't care about dorms, i'm not 18 anymore and I travel with my SO, 50-70 bucks for a dorm is nonsense still.

It's sad for young people. I was able to afford backpacking in Europe 10 years ago when I was 18, it seems it's impossible nowadays without couchsurfing.

Btw I usually look prices on Booking and Hostelworlds.

Edit: a lot of interesting comments and responses!

I see a lot of people mentioning Sweden should not be at the top as it is the rape capital - as I understand it the reason for this is that they have defined rape as a broad term to cover more types of sexual assault than other countries, this leads to women feeling more confident in being able to report sexual crimes.

It was mentioned that focusing on only the positive mentions would skew the data somewhat so I will take a look at that today where a negative mention will deduct from the positive for a country.

It has also been raised that there should be specification on if the countries are safe fire women of colour to travel. This should be taken into consideration and will be reviewed in any further data updates.

Would people find value it a larger ongoing data set or website?

1e2pw8i,"African American Women in Rome, Racism Yes, but Mainly Positive",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e2pw8i/african_american_women_in_rome_racism_yes_but/,701,"Here in Rome for 3 days before embarking on a cruise with my mom and teenage daughter around the Mediterranean.  I know people are traveling here frequently and have some fears around racism abroad so I thought I'd share our experiences in Rome.  

I'll get the negative experiences out of the way first. We went on a food tour through Trastevere. There was 8 of us plus our Italian tour guide. Everyone was white except us. As we were walking through a crowd of young Italian males (probably early 20s), one of them says the word ""Monkey"", out of nowhere in English. We were at the end of the line in our tour so I don't think anyone else in our group heard.  I was so shocked that I actually questioned myself for about 5 minutes whether I actually heard that. But I did. A feeling of sadness began to settle over me. I did some mental and emotional wrestling and decided to not let a miserable racist person have that affect on me. I feel like it's letting them win, it's giving them what they want. If my mom or daughter heard it, they didn't say anything and neither did I.  We didn't discuss it with each other. This is my first time discussing this.  So that happened, but by the time we started tasting food, I was distracted enough to move past it and enjoy our tour.  


On the flip side, a hotel clerk at a hotel we weren't staying in saved the day when she let me use her personal adapter to charge my phone for 20 minutes. It died and I had no idea how to get to the meet up spot for our tour.  After going to a grocery store and a restaurant where no one could (or would) help, she did that and was so sweet and gracious about it.  Everyone at the hotel was very friendly towards us as we cooled off, got water and waited while my phone charged. Since we weren't staying there, I was worried how they might treat us but everything was cool.  

I would describe customer service as nuetral. Not overly friendly (but sometimes).  The only other questionable thing was today when the meetup person ( not our guide) for the Colosseum turned their back to me and my daughter as I approached them to check in.  I said ""Ciao, scusi,  we need to check in please"". He turned around and apologized profusely and checked us in and apologized more. All the apologizing made me think he turned his back on us on purpose and maybe it was a race thing but I'm not sure.  

We've sat in quite a few restaurants and had mid to great experiences.  All of our tour guides were fantastic. Rome itself is a true site to see with so much history it's all mind blowing. 

As far as pick pockets and hustlers are concerned, just keep your head on a swivel.  At the Termini train station we were definitely targeted. We were super obvious tourists looking extremely confused and weak trying to figure out how to buy tickets to Trastevere and then back to the airport. People kept approaching us, calling us ""sister"" and at first my mom kept being too nice and interacting with everyone. She bought a scarf üò© at the Vatican. But after that she just kept quiet while I said no thanks no thanks to everyone. But they are SUPER PERSISTENT. This guy literally threw a ""free"" bracelet at my daughter after we kept refusing it. We just let it hit the ground and kept moving. 

My advice is to not be surprised if someone is blatantly racist towards you if you're black. But also don't let that stop you from coming here. Why should racist people get what they want and prevent us from living our best life?

Another thing that happened is that a tourist from Kazakhstan was filming us as we were eating dinner at a food court type place at the airport. My mom, caught her and said ,""why are you recording us? Please stop it right now"" to which she replied, ""I'm from kazakhstan"" and keeps recording us. My mom then says ""ok. you need to stop filming us right now"" Then the lady comes over and the woman she's FaceTiming tells my mom , ""I'm from kazakhstan"". Before my mom totally loses it, I said to the lady, ""You're being rude, it doesn't matter where you're from, please leave us alone, and stop recording us right now."" She finally walks away. That was wild. But not an uncommon experience when traveling while black. So many people have no idea how to act when they see people who don't look like them and everyone else where they're from. They start treating you like you're an exhibit at the museum. 

So we're leaving tomorrow. I have mixed feelings because it's been ""a lot"" in both good and bad ways. I'd like to come back in the slow season though. The positive experiences heavily outweighed the negative. There's so much we didn't get to see. We're on to France, Tunisia, Greece, Malta and Spain next. Wish us good luck and please share any experiences you've had in those places so I'll know what to expect. Thanks in advance. ",306,2024-07-13 20:05:36,aresellersjourney,0.8

To be clear I didn‚Äôt say anything the whole entirety of the four hour flight except that one time the younger one stood up and suddenly screamed at the top of his lungs. At that height his tiny mouth was right next to my ears and I jumped up and said jeez! 

I empathize with their mom but she didn‚Äôt do anything to quiet them. She must be tired. The kids weren‚Äôt in any distress. Just playful as evidenced by shrill screaming (ok) and kicking my seat ( not ok.) 

The older one (4 ish) kept egging the younger (1 ish) one and the decibel range kept going up. 

My kids were at that age once and I know we only remember pleasant things but I don‚Äôt think they destroyed the eardrums of passengers at that age at this extent. At the very least I wouldn‚Äôt let them kick the back of the seats.

I alternately sympathized with the mom and internally got mad at her for at least not saying anything to the kids. They surely do understand the word ‚Äúno?‚Äù

19ef0bs,I brought a sketchbook on my first trip to Italy.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19ef0bs,706,"My partner and I took advantage of a sale on Icelandair for $400ish from the East coast of the US to Rome and spent ten days in Italy (8 nights in Rome, 2 in Florence) this month. It was my first trip to Italy and really my first trip to mainland Europe and I brought a sketchbook and watercolors.

There are pros and cons to going in January, but overall the crowds were much smaller than anticipated which was lovely.  We still had gelato every day and ate outside more often than not (I am grateful for long underwear and outdoor heaters.) 

Each painting is labeled. It turns out the cute alley in #5, Via dei Leutari, was the site of some serious intrigue and murder in the 1500s. I'm sure there are similar stories for any little street in Rome.

The way ancient ruins are interspersed in a modern city with Baroque fountains and renaissance buildings is very cool). And one of my favorite things is all the ways Italians eat (and drink) artichokes (last picture.)",36,2024-01-24 05:30:46,upsidedownbat,0.99

1f64y4f,Loving Ljubljana and the nature in Slovenia (Jan 2024),https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f64y4f,693,"I visited Slovenia for around a week in early January this year. Slovenia had always been on my travel bucket list due to its stunning nature and beautiful cities while not being too touristy like some of the other top-tier destinations in Europe are.

Slovenia does not disappoint at all. It‚Äôs a fantastic country that is not big in size but still has a lot to offer. The caves, the Alps, the lakes, the coast‚Ä¶ all of them easily accessible from the capital city of Ljubljana within 2.5 hours. I didn‚Äôt drive and only relied on public transport 99% of the time, but still got to visit all these places and had a great time.

There is the Postojna Caves in Slovenia which is very famous and I believe would be a fun experience. But after doing my research, I decided to pre-book and visit the Skocjan Caves, a UNESCO world heritage site, instead. After taking a train from Ljubljana to Divaca, I took a short taxi ride (~10 minutes) to the Caves for the tour. Photos are not allowed inside the caves, so I could only take photos once we were near the exit and allowed to do so. Even though there are no photos, I can assure that the canyons and all those interesting rocks inside are gorgeous and totally worth seeing. It is surreal hearing the sound of water flowing swiftly deep down the cliff. I highly recommend you all to go there and experience it by yourselves.

During the winter, some of the roads in the Alps would be closed. Hence, I only visited Lake Bohinj and Lake Bled near the mountain area. Lake Bohinj was very very quiet during my visit - I think I only saw no more than 10 other people there! While the boat tours were not available and some of the hotels / restaurants seemed to be closed, I enjoyed being there and wandering around the lake. The backdrop of the snow-capped mountains made the lake very picturesque. Comparatively, Lake Bled was more popular but still had a manageable crowd. I heard that Lake Bled could be very crowded during the summer, so I am glad to be there in January even though probably fewer activities were available. 

Ljubljana, the capital city, is also stunningly beautiful. What impressed me the most is how green, clean and environmentally-friendly the city is. You could see recycling initiatives everywhere - not only the big recycling boxes all over the city, but also details like the Christmas tree in the town hall decorated with children‚Äôs plastic bottle paintings.

It was January already, but the Christmas lights  and decorations were still on. I joined a walking tour and the tour guide (who‚Äôs a very nice person) told us that there is a theme for the decorations every year, and the theme for Dec 2023 was inclusion and diversity. It was very impressive seeing all those decorations that told a story and conveyed a message. Weirdly, it made me feel that the city has a really kind soul!

Knowing that the roads to some of the remote places in Slovenia are closed in winter, I hope to return to Slovenia in other seasons to see more of it - especially Velika Planina and Bovec!

To me Paris is a clean city. I come from south America and there definitely the city is dirty and smells bad, but Paris was just normal for a metropolitan city. 
I understand French people have their way of being. Politeness is KEY. Always I was arriving in places speaking in my limited french ""bonjour, si vous plais je vous prendre.."" and people would even help me by correcting when I say something wrong. But always in a kind way they would do that, smiling and attentive. 

So I really liked everything, Parisienne people were polite and i could even engage in conversations with French people

1dmobm0,Came back from Marrakesh and genuinely don't understand all the hate. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dmobm0/came_back_from_marrakesh_and_genuinely_dont/,685,"Just spent a long weekend in Marrakesh and couldn't help but fall in love with the city! This was my first trip out of Europe and after reading so many horror stories here, I mentally prepared for dirty and smelly streets, full of pushy salesmen, scammers and animal abuse. Instead, I found a beautiful surprise.

These are my impressions on the city:

Cleanliness. The vendors were pouring water all the time in front of their shop to cool the air, so the streets weren't smelly or dirty at all. Little to no garbage, only the Jewish neighborhood was a bit more run down.

Animal abuse. It was a bit sad to see the monkeys and the snakes at Jemaa el-Fnaa, but at the end of the day worse things happen at bullfighting or marine parks. Some cats were skinny and shaggy, but all seemed cared for and there was water and food for them at every corner.

Scams and pushy salesmen. I don't consider myself a seasoned traveler, but having been multiple times to Rome, Paris and Barcelona, I had my fair share of unwanted roses and bracelets. I was ready to put on my RBF if necessary but surprisingly, nothing happened.

At Jemma el-Fnaa nobody approached us, no henna tattoos, no unwanted snakes around my neck. At the souk also nobody harassed us, occasionally some waiter would invite us to seat but we just kept walking or said no thank you. We didn't encounter anyone trying to show us the way or walk us to the riad.

Food and shopping. We went to some touristy places like Comptoir Darna but the best food was from little corner restaurants at 50-70 dirham pp. We especially loved the north-west part of the Medina, where we were staying and seemed much more authentic and less touristy. I also found here the best shops and negotiated little to not at all, I feel like if I'm paying a pair of sandals 15‚Ç¨ to a toothless guy, those 5 extra euros make more of a difference to him rather than to me.

I'm 35F and was traveling with my husband, sometimes we would get separated when looking at things or taking pictures, so I'm not sure if my experience was going to be different had I traveled alone.

In summary, it's a beautiful destination which receives undeserved hate. Ultimately, it made me realize how much bias and preconceived ideas we have about places and every trip it's possible to free your mind more and more.

EDIT: I didn't expect so many comments, even if this is such a controversial topic. I understand that the experience vary extremely for every traveler and tons of factors may influence it.

Some tips on how we behave, maybe it can help others:

- we didn't engage with anyone calling us, avoiding even eye contact. We didn't accept any free stuff, any invitation.

* we didn't get too close to any vendor unless really interested. We would take advantage of the crowds to browse and quietly select what to buy later.
* when we got lost we would keep walking. only one of us at a time would casually look at the phone, guiding the way. We would avoid standing in a place looking completely lost or discussing about which direction we should move. If completely lost, we would sit in a caf√© to regroup.",216,2024-06-23 10:12:03,Hot-Breath-9149,0.78

I loathe early morning flights (before 9 am) to the point that I'll take connecting flights that take 2 or 3 times as long to avoid them. Most of my flights are intra-Europe flights of 1-3 hours. I'll pay more for a later flight (within reason), book flights with a connection or fly to another airport further away and then take a train or bus.

I hate getting up in the middle of the night with only a few hours sleep. I don‚Äôt function well with less than 5-6 hours of sleep. A lot of people prefer early AM flights as you normally arrive early enough to have at least half a day to explore wherever you‚Äôre going. This isn‚Äôt the case for me however as if I‚Äôve only got a few hours of sleep I‚Äôll have run out of energy by 4-5 pm. I also tend to have a very low appetite when I‚Äôm sleep deprived so there‚Äôs no point going to a restaurant.

I much prefer flying out a day earlier instead in the late afternoon or evening, even if that means an extra hotel night.

1gqdjex,Frankfurt Airport (FRA) is the worst airport ever,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/s/KQEaUPuw2p,663,"I posted this in r/TravelHacks some weeks ago about layovers in Frankfurt, and thought it would be interesting to share in this sub about my experience connecting there. But for starters: I never thought, as a traveller, that I could hate an airport so much. 

For starters - remote positions for a 747 is such a dumb idea. Arriving there and a tow truck broke on our assigned gate. Not a great start. Then comes endless walking and confusing signage, coming back to where you started, the same concourse having Schengen and non-Schengen flights. I even exited the security zone by mistake and there were no signs whatsoever about this. 

Then comes very rude and unhelpful staff: security agents speaking German even when you say out loud you do not speak the language. One agent before passport control pretending he wasn‚Äôt listening to what I said and acting like I was stupid. I have not seen one single smile or politeness in those people. 

The mice! Right by a Lufthansa lounge, a mouse comes off the wall, grabs a piece of food from the floor and comes back. Or just casually crossing one side of the corridor to the other. Are the mice traps working? Guess not. 

I‚Äôve been to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Madrid, Milan and all of those make sense, have centralised passport/security controls, and helpful personnel. It‚Äôs a shame that Lufthansa (which seems to own that place given how many flights they operate) allows this to happen.

I'm currently on a month long trip to Albania and Greece and decided it would be a good idea to share my thoughts. Hopefully this post can help someone else travelling there soon. I've already posted my Albania trip report so this will just be Greece, Part 1 (I waffle on too much so decided to split the Greece section in two)! I'm travelling solo, carry on only and use public transportation everywhere.


**Athens**

This is a tough one and it's probably controversial but Athens was...just good? I spent three full days and probably could've cut one. I think Athens would be more fun with a partner or friends as there were lots of cool bars, cafes and restaurants that would be fun to make a day of. 


I also think I am just done with big cities - once you've seen a few you've seen them all right? I hate saying that because it sounds so pretentious and privileged and I'm grateful to be able to travel but I'm just past the city stage. 


The highlight was definitely the Acropolis and Museum. I highly recommend, in fact insist, that you do a guided tour of the Acropolis. There's not a whole lot of information around the Slopes so unless you know Greek history, it'd be a 20 mins visit for some pictures and that's it. It was invaluable to have a guide explain all the different temples, when they were built, and the mythology and history to go with them. I did the 'Acropolis &amp; Parthenon: History, Myths, &amp; Masterpieces, Extended Edition' with Athens Walking Tours and it was 100% worth every Euro. 


I did the Museum on my own and that's manageable. There's lots of information in there and some incredible artifacts. I did this the same day as the Acropolis which may have been a mistake. It was a looonnggg day and I was definitely 'history-ed' out by the end. 


I also did a walking food tour with Athens Walks - also incredible and so so much food. The last stop for souvlaki pita ended up being takeaway and I had it for dinner that night after I got back from a sunset tour to the Temple of Posideon. 


So that's two days full of activities. The third day I was exhausted and couldn't face another museum or ruin. I ended up wandering through the National Garden for a couple of hours (I love gardens) before heading up to Philopappos Hill in the afternoon for excellent views of the Acropolis and Athens. 


I stayed at Urban Tales - 4 nights 


**Koufonisi**

A flight to Naxos and then ferry to Koufonisi, the jewel of the Cyclades. I almost don't want to share this gem so I can keep it all to myself but travel is not about gatekeeping. 


Side note before I get into Koufonisi - arriving at the port in Naxos reassured me that I had made the right decision to avoid Santorini. There was a ferry awaiting embarkation and there were hundreds of people waiting to board. And thats just one ferry. I don't understand how you could possibly enjoy an island with that many people, especially with the amount of islands that Greece has, but happy to hear people's opinions! 


Koufonisi is paradise and exactly what I wanted from a Greek island. Turquoise water, white and blue buildings, pink bougainvillea, it's what dreams are made of. 


Koufonisi was just lively enough with tourists (both Greek and foreign) that I didn't feel isolated, lots of restaurants and beautiful shops but it was peaceful and calm. There's basically one main street, and all the beaches are walkable from town. I spent two blissful days at Alejandra Beach and I would happily fly from Australia just to spend a week or two on this island. 


On Koufonisi I stayed at Nysis. This was the splurge part of my trip and oh my goodness did it deliver. The owners and staff are incredible, with nothing being too much trouble. I've already recommended this spot to several friends planning their honeymoons. 


**Naxos**
 
After a sad goodbye to Koufonisi, it was time to catch the ferry to Naxos for four nights. 


I'm not sure if being in Koufonisi first marred my expectations but Naxos did not live up to them. In my research, it read like it was a popular island with lots of beautiful, stereotypical Cycladic streets and picturesque beaches but I really struggled to find it. Was I walking around the wrong areas? I don't know. I think I also have a very different concept of a 'good beach' coming from Australia. A wide stretch of golden sand for kilometres is just home to me and nothing special (again, I hate saying that). Give me a pebbly cove with turquoise water any day. 


I found Naxos overrun with tourists (I acknowledge I am also a tourist) and I just didn't feel good there. All the twisty-turny streets were filled with souvenir shops and I felt like I couldn't breathe. 


Luckily, the public bus network is quite good so I escaped the hustle and bustle and went down to Alyko beach for two of my days. This was much more like what I was after, with golden sand and pebbles, clear blue water and plenty of space for everyone. 


I also hate to say it, but my best day in Naxos was the day I went to Paros. I caught the first ferry over and spent the day in Parikia, Lefkes and Naoussa before returning on the 6pm ferry. The public bus network is very good however some lines have reduced runs heading into the end of the season so I had to do Parikia-Lefkes return and then Parikia-Naoussa return. Still very manageable and I had one to two hours in each town to wander around. 


Paros felt much more elegant than Naxos. All three towns had beautiful buildings, cobbled streets, brightly coloured doors and windows, and the shops felt much more boutique rather than souvenirs. 


Everything I read suggested that Naxos and Paros were much of a muchness and I couldn't go wrong with either, however they felt completely different to me and if I had my time over I would definitely choose Paros.  


**Money in Greece**

As expected, Greece is almost cashless. I just carry a bit of cash for the bus in case I have to buy tickets from the driver. 


Food was reasonably priced (coming from Australia, even with our terrible exchange rate). I generally alternated between cheap souvlaki pita (‚Ç¨6-7 for pita and drink) and restaurant dinners (‚Ç¨20-30 for seafood, sometimes a salad, and a drink) 


**Ferries in Greece**

Maybe I've been lucky but so far I've had a great experience with the ferries. Always on time, efficient and smooth sailing. The whole thing is a well oiled machine. 


The ferry port can feel overwhelming at first, especially if there's a few ferries arriving/leaving close together. The main thing is to know what vessel you are on (World champion jet, Super Runner, Jumbo Jet etc). Your ticket will tell you the name of the ship. It doesn't matter about the company (most are Seajets) or the destination. Just get on the right vessel. When a ferry arrives it's a fast on and off process. Have your ticket ready for scanning and your luggage organised. The Port Police will yell at you to hurry up and get on the ship. Another reason I was glad to have a backpack - the ramps onto the bigger car ferries are brutal on roller bags. I saw many people struggling to drag their bags. Just pick them up and carry them. The Seajets crew will continue yelling at you to really cement the experience. 


As expected, English is widely spoken by all ages and I have had no trouble communicating. The Greek people are probably the friendliest I've met on my travels. So eager to help, make a phone call for me, give me directions and just say hello on the street. 


I'm off to Sifnos tomorrow then Milos to round out my trip. I plan on doing a boat tour on Milos but welcome any other suggestions on either island! ",38,2024-09-13 13:48:32,Emotional-Cry5236,0.99

She can‚Äôt talk about something else since‚Ä¶Halloween. The trip is in a few weeks now.

Tonight she calls me because all of the Airbnb she booked a while ago cancelled on her on the same day. 
First two bookings just got cancelled by the hosts in Turin and Milan. Now the Firenze one has been emailing her asking my mom to cancel. Host is saying he doesn‚Äôt want to lose is superhost status if he cancels himself (lol).

Told my mom to never cancel and to call Airbnb directly first thing in the morning.

I googled and there‚Äôs nothing in the news regarding new laws in Europe or Italy that could trigger such a sudden uptick in cancellations.

Is it just bad luck or something is happening?

My mother has a strong profile on Airbnb with a lot of good reviews. It‚Äôs not her first rodeo on the platform and she is overwhelmingly nice to people. I doubt hosts saw red flags in her, causing them wanting to cancel.

So,  anyone else ?

Edit: didn't expect this post to get this much traction! I won't disclose exactly when my mother is going on vacation because duh, but it's close or during the fall, so way after the Olympics or any summer events (Taylor Swift, festivals, etc). I'm aware of shitty hosts behavior on Airbnb (and how Airbnb has been falling from grace for a few years now). It's just the timing of all the cancelations in only Italy's locations (out of a dozen total locations in 4 countries) that were weird. In conclusion, no new legislation, just bad timing.

Hop on point: it is now Fderik, not Zouerat. Train can depart anytime after 12 but for me it arrived into Fderik at 1:30pm and departed at 2:15. Usually 12-4 in that window. The hop on point is by marker 628, I attached an image at the end. 

To Choum (the first stop) is about 5 hours give or take. The train stopped at Choum for about 15 minutes. 

Overnight gets cold even in the summer so bring layers. I had a ski jacket and a blanket and my teeth were still chattering. 

Arrival into Nouadhibou was 7:10 am for us. 

Please get off around the 20km mark and quickly. The train will stop for about 5 mins and you will see taxis chasing. The taxi to the town is about 2-300 local currently (6$USD). Someone I know rode it all the way to the port and got arrested. 

Hope this helps, I‚Äôll leave my opinion out of it this time but the only thing I‚Äôll say is was an incredible experience.

I DESPISE when high-end hotels try to force you to use luggage porters. I just got to a fancy hotel for a work conference, and as soon as the shuttle bus from the airport arrived, the porters immediately swarmed and began stacking the luggage, then asked us to tag our rooms to them.

To me, it‚Äôs the definition of an anti-service. Rather than just taking my luggage to my room and having immediate access to the contents, I now have to wait for up to a half-hour or more for it to be delivered. Not to mention I grudgingly tip them a buck or two since it‚Äôs considered customary. So I end up literally paying for worse service.

Practically every high-end hotel has them - feels like an anachronism. There may be edge-cases where it makes sense (for example, if you have a physical disability or are carrying so much luggage that it‚Äôs physically difficult to move it around). But for the average physically able person with only a single roller bag, it‚Äôs the dumbest shit. And yes, you can decline, but I‚Äôve had scenarios where they literally start giving attitude or arguing that they MUST deliver it.

I'll start with my latest stupid mistake so hopefully this will help someone avoid such a costly mistake in the future.

My wife and I recently traveled to Panama from The Netherlands. We are non-EU citizens and our passport is crap so we need a VISA to most countries in the world. However, our EU residence permit gives us VISA-free access to a few countries including Panama. This was one of the main reasons why we decided to visit Panama after checking out a few other destinations and spending MANY hours planning a detailed itinerary for a trip to South Africa which required a VISA that we could not get.

Once we settled on Panama and had an itinerary ready, I proceeded to book accommodations and flights. The flight I chose departs from Frankfurt  and flies into David with layovers in Washington and Panama City. Additionally, I booked a Flix bus to Frankfurt, and a train for the return back home from Frankfurt airport.

The day before our flight around 9 PM, as we were packing and excited for the upcoming couple of weeks, I received an email to check-in for our flight. I decided to do that real quick so I can take a break from packing. While going through the check-in process, I found out that because we are transiting through the US, we should've obtained a TRANSIT US VISA!!! I jumped onto Google to check if that's something I can do real quick by submitting an online form and paying a fee. Nope! You have to apply for an appointment at the consulate and go through the whole VISA process just because you're gonna land in an airport and then run to your gate to catch your next flight :)

Luckily, I had a US VISA that was issued for me because of a work event a few months before. But, my wife does not have a US VISA so she could not take the flight. A couple of hours later, I had booked her a direct flight from Amsterdam into Panama City, an internal flight from PC to David, and a hotel near the airport in PC. Those costs in addition to train fees from/to Schipol Airport (AMS) came at around 2100 EUR (**$2270**).

This made me think, which country (or region) has the most potential to become a tourist hotspot within the next few years if it wasn't for internal conflicts, political instability or safety/crime?

I think that if things get better for Myanmar, they could become just as popular as other SEA countries. I also find it hard to understand why Eritrea hasn't capitalized off of its long stretch of coast along the Red Sea like their nearby neighbor Egypt has. It has the same year-round warm climate, a stunning turquoise coastline dotted with coral reefs and it's relatively close to both Europe and the Middle East. I also think the Venezuelan coast has a lot of potential, the beaches there are just as beautiful as neaby Aruba &amp; Cura√ßao, but for a fraction of the cost. Bahia in Brazil is another destination I can see blowing up soon, it has gained popularity with celebrities as an exclusive lowkey destination, so I can't understand why it wouldn't become mainstream soon.

They say I am too young and that I have no money when I do. I keep explaining the situation but they won‚Äôt budge. 

UPDATE: thank you everyone for the advice and support!! i just wanted to clarify things after reading everything.
1. yes i am paying for myself. I work for my own money. Im financially independent. I go to school with scholarships. This trip is just for vacation. They say I got no money because they assume i spend it right away.
2. To apply for a new passport, i need my birth certificate, which my mom also has. I can always get a copy from the courthouse, but then id have to do an urgent travel appointment, which i think i might do
3. My parents are hispanic and super strict, they just think I‚Äôm too young and inexperienced to travel. I dont want to go as far as to call the police. Its also hard because I need a place to stay in the summer for summer break, and thats when i am taking my trip. itll be hard to physically leave.

UPDATE 2: thank u guys for the support! me and my partner have been together for 4.5 years. i was able to get my passport but my parents now know i have it. they are really really upset. they had to call my partners parents and tell them i dont have permission. thankfully they are on my side, but when im back home in the summer for break, my parents are probably going to be even more strict and hold a grudge against me forever",316,2024-03-17 16:32:44,No-Log7129,0.86

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Most of the places we stayed were booked through either [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Airbnb (booking.com was a much cheaper option most of the time)

1c3ygeg,Buenos Aires Experience (33F Solo) and Info April 2024,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c3ygeg,613,"This is the first time I‚Äôve written a post like this but trying to pay it back/ forward since I‚Äôve learned a ton from Reddit and find it rly useful when planning trips!

I (33F) just spent 4.5 days in Buenos Aires solo this April 2024 and here are some notes I have that might be helpful to others. 

(For context, I‚Äôm from and have mostly lived in Toronto so I‚Äôm seeing BA through those eyes). 

Safety:

I stayed in Palermo but walked around a ton through the various neighbourhoods. I had zero problems walking around and never felt unsafe. I wasn‚Äôt hassled at all or ever had anyone bother me. 

I spent time in Palermo, El Centro, Recoleta, San Telmo and also El Caminito (colourful streets in Boca). I did cab to El Caminito (because I was told not to walk from San Telmo) but once there it felt super safe ‚Äî filled with tourists, and there also were some police hovering around the sort of ‚Äòborders‚Äô of El Caminito. 

I took the Subte (the metro) multiple times and a bus back from El Caminito and the stations and trains were busy, well lit and there was nothing questionable that went down. 

I didn‚Äôt spent a lot of time out at night but did walk home in the dark. I also went to see a tango show one night and took the Subte there and then walked around after trying to hail a cab. 

Of course this is my experience, and anything can happen. But overall I actually felt less on edge in these areas here than downtown in Toronto or other North American cities as of late. The sad reality is there are mental health and addiction crises in NA and that manifests in people acting erratically bc they are in crisis. And since there are inadequate social supports and places to go, it‚Äôs occurring in the streets.in comparison, I just felt pretty at ease here. 

Cash/Credit Card situation: 

A rough measure is that $1 US is about $1000 Argentinian pesos, right now, give or take.  

Almost everywhere (beyond taxis and really small stores) seems to take credit card and also have tap. I used Apple Pay with my Visa continuously with no issues and no one seemed to have a problem with it. It seemed very normal and conventional across the city. 

I do think it‚Äôs still good to have some cash for tipping and also for small stands/ taxis. The taxis I took seemed to want to be paid in cash.

There is, of course, the blue rate and the official exchange rate (used by banks and ATMs). Western Union will give close to the blue rate and so you can transfer yourself money and then go pick it up. You can also bring US dollars (they apparently prefer crisp, new $100 bills) and exchange them at unofficial cambrios. 

I did the latter and exchanged about $300 US. I found a cambrio with Google Maps, looked up the blue rate that day so I knew I wasn‚Äôt getting ripped off, and exchanged money that way. It was a very easy process that took about 5 min. I didn‚Äôt get quite the blue rate but it was pretty close. Be prepared that you will be getting bricks of cash bc $1000 bills seem to be standard. 

Visa and MasterCard give you something close to the blue rate so it makes sense to use them. 

As an aside, there is about a 10-15% difference between the blue rate and the official rate right now. There have been times when the difference has been way larger apparently so, although it matters, it‚Äôs not as big a deal now as it can be. 

Transport:

There is a pretty extensive Subte (metro) system and also tons of buses. They all require you have a Sube Card which you can get at a station. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how much it cost per ride (I think it varies on buses) but $1000 pesos was good for multiple trips and the card itself (basically it‚Äôs really cheap). 

I also took a taxi from San Telmo to El Caminito that was $2400 pesos, then a cab from San Telmo to Palermo that was $7000 pesos, and then from Palermo to Jorge Newbury airport for about $6000. 

From Ezeiza, the flat rate to Palermo was $40 US. There is a taxi stand when you get right out of customs and I‚Äôd heard it was legit and had a good experience using it. They also told me if I was coming back to Ezeiza to keep my receipt and it would be $28 US and I could arrange through WhatsApp. 

Between Subte and taxis, I found it super easy and cheap to get around. There is some bad traffic as an FYI so definitely be aware of that. 

There is also an app called Cabify that I didn‚Äôt use but is popular, and then Uber also can be used here apparently. There are also lots of taxis in the streets so it‚Äôs very possible to hail them (I did this multiple times). 

Mosquito Situation:

There was (as news stories have covered) a significant increase in Dengue Fever the past few months and lots of reports on swarms of mosquitos, etc.

That being said, although I did get bit maybe 3-4 times over my stay (ironically one time was at the airport when I‚Äôd first arrived in the middle of the night), I definitely didn‚Äôt feel they were everywhere (and mosquitos tend to love me). I actually stopped wearing bug spray after the first day bc it seemed like a non issue.

I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs not a lot of bug spray here so I would recommend bringing it in case. I wasn‚Äôt looking for it but I didn‚Äôt see any anywhere while here. 

That being said, I did avoid parks bc I‚Äôd read they are the worst there.

Language:

I speak pretty terrible Spanish, as in I have Duolingo so know some basics but other than that am hopeless.

English is generally pretty well spoken, but Google Translate is also a good resource if necessary. I have it on my phone (I have an Airalo eSIM) and just pulled it out and showed someone if I rly needed it. I actually had a full blown conversation for an hour w my taxi driver w Google Translate on the speaker converse mode bc he spoke little English and it worked surprisingly well. 

I found people seemed to appreciate that I tried to speak Spanish (even tho it was kind of pathetic) and everyone was very friendly and kind about my limited abilities. 

Tipping:

I‚Äôd read that tipping 10% in restaurants, cafes and taxis is conventional so I did that (sometimes went over depending on the bills I had) and everyone seemed happy. 

Highlights of My Stay: 

Recoleta Cemetery ‚Äî I heard this was a ‚Äòmust see‚Äô and didn‚Äôt really get why until I went. It was such a unique cemetery and also so eery with a strange energy. Eva Peron is buried here and so stop by there, but also I found some of the older mausoleums fascinating (many had glass doors so you could see inside, which definitely made me feel a kind of way).

Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes ‚Äî Free, not too big so you can see everything in 1-2 hours and amazing collection of European paintings and Argentinian art. They also have a lovely Rodin collection! 

Free walking tour ‚Äî I did mine through the main group, Buenos Aires Free Walks. You can book online and there are multiple ones each day. I did the one in El Centro with Martin and learned a ton and rly enjoyed it. He also gave a big list of recommendations via email after to everyone. Group was about 15 people which apparently was ‚Äòsmall‚Äô so they‚Äôre a good size. 

Tango show ‚Äî I honestly think you have to do this if you‚Äôre here since it‚Äôs the birth of Argentine Tango. I went to Alijibe bc I wanted to go earlier (it started at 8pm and most don‚Äôt until 11ish) and also didn‚Äôt want to have dinner (they have a show only option). I thought it was great and everything I wanted in a tango show ‚Äî dancing, a live singer, and some other styles of dancing mixed in. 

Steak ‚Äî I made a lunch reservation at La Carniceria and rly enjoyed it. Although I probably wouldn‚Äôt order deer again (this was one of the steaks on offer that the server recommended) it was very memorable and the toppers made it delicious. I sat at the bar and the bartenders/ servers were also extremely nice and helpful (and spoke excellent English). I think lunch reservations are generally easier to get so I‚Äôd recommend that if booking last minute. 

Pizza at Pizzeria Guerrin ‚Äî Kind of touristy (it‚Äôs a big operation) but I loved it. The pizza is so cheesy and was very unique. I got the chica Fugazetta which I think is one of their specialties and ate half there and took away the rest bc it was huge. 

Walking around San Telmo ‚Äî I found it the most charming area with cobblestone streets and little shops. I‚Äôd also definitely recommend cabbing to El Caminito from here bc it‚Äôs worth seeing and isn‚Äôt too far via cab. 

Palermo ‚Äî I would definitely stay here again. It‚Äôs a charming area with quiet, tree lined streets and lots of cafes and restaurants and shops. It‚Äôs also on a metro line so it‚Äôs very easy to get from here to Plaza de Mayo and downtown. 

Overall:

I really enjoyed my stay ‚Äî Buenos Aires is such an eclectic city with amazing (and wide ranging) architecture, a great cafe culture and food, and was also just very functional. It‚Äôs easy to get around and felt safe, and I didn‚Äôt encounter any issues that detracted from my experience. 

The Argentinian people are very warm , friendly and also helpful. I found there was just a good energy here. 

I found 4 days was enough for me ‚Äî I got to see a good amount of the city and fit in the main things I wanted to. Obviously there‚Äôs always more to see but it was a good ‚Äòtaster‚Äô and so would recommend this length of stay.

\*Why I‚Äôm not keen of spending so much extra to fly business class: 1) I am a petite woman and feel like I have enough space in economy 2) I have a strict, unusual medical diet that airlines never get right, so I usually just carry all my own food to eat on the plane.

1c5w8ev,Istanbul didn't live up to what I expected,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c5w8ev/istanbul_didnt_live_up_to_what_i_expected/,611,"33M here who loves to travel with my wife. I've been wanting to visit Istanbul since high school, the city has such a rich and diverse history behind it. Everyone online has such glowing reviews/experiences of visiting Istanbul, I just couldn't wait to visit. Finally got to spend a good 3 days in the city on a deliberate multi-day layover in April 2024. I don't know what exactly happened, but it didn't quite live up to what I expected from the overall experience. I've enjoyed spending time in other cities in Europe a lot more. Thinking about it, I came up with a list of things that I didn't like - not sure if this was specific to my own experience or if its the case in general.

1. Most taxi drivers here are just plain rude and want to leech every single penny off of tourists. They refuse to turn on the meter and then quote exorbitant prices for small distances ($30 for 3 km?). I had to argue a lot or shuffle through a lot of cabbies to get one that would charge a reasonable amount or go by meter. On top of that all of them drove like absolute maniacs, most of them were hitting 100+ kmph on city roads whenever they got a chance. I was shitting bricks in the back seat whenever I got into a cab in Istanbul.
2. Unimaginably high entry ticket prices. As I understand this is a recent development, but Istanbul now has the most expensive tourist attractions in the world. A visit to the Topkapi palace? $47. Wanna see the 'actually-should-be-free-to-visit' Hagia Sofia? $28. A visit to the Dolmabahce palace? $40. I couldn't get over the sticker shock of how expensive they've made all the attractions - they now cost almost twice as much as similar attractions in Western Europe. Topkapi is now the most expensive museum in the world.
3. The absence of byzantine history. This one was the biggest letdown. One of the main draws for me travelling to Istanbul was to see and experience its time as the capital of the Byzantine Empire. However, there is almost no focus on promoting/developing the byzantine era places as big ticket tourist attractions, with the basilica cistern being the only notable exception. The majority tourist attractions in Istanbul are the mosques/Otttoman era places. There are some remnants here and there but I didn't get the impression that they were well cared for and promoted as places of importance. First Hagia Sofia, and now the Chora being converted to a mosque gave me the impression that the govt or the locals don't care much for keeping Byzantine era places as pristine world heritage sites/museums. 
4. The food. In the days I was there, I ate the worst falafel, the worst ketchup (how can you possibly mess this up??), the worst hummus, the worst Omelette, and the worst kebabs I've ever had in my life. From what I gather, the core tourist area (Sultanahmet) is known for bad and overpriced food, but I mean come on, how come all the 7 restaurants I ate at were bad experiences? I only went to places with a 4.5+ rating on google. There were also strictly only two street food snacks on every corner - corn and pretzel. Got tired of snacking on them on my 3rd day.
5. The bazaars. To my surprise, selling counterfeit goods (fake Gucci/LV bags and belts) for exorbitant prices is the norm here in Istanbul, you cannot walk two blocks without running into a store which sells these items. I was looking forward to shopping in the Grand bazaar, but found it ridiculously overpriced, even after haggling. Between the taxi drivers, museum ticket prices and this, I felt like a walking $ sign just waiting to be milked by the locals.

TL;DR - went to Istanbul expecting a world class city filled with rich history and culture. Experienced unfriendly people, a rob-the-tourist mentality, below average food, and poorly preserved byzantine history.

Edit 1:

I'm aware falafel and Hummus are not Turkish food, but I have certain dietary restrictions that forced certain meal choices. That's no reason for the food to be that bad. Hummus is food from the neighboring region, and is simple to make. It's not an unreasonable expectation to expect it to be decent.

To all the people asking why I had to hail cabs instead of taking public transport, I had a leg condition that forced me to minimize walking. I tried using taxi apps but never succeeded in getting a taxi through them.

To others telling me Hagia Sofia is free, I would like to let you know that as of Jan/Feb 2024, it is not free for non-Muslims/non-Turks (verbatim words by the security guards). If you're a non-Muslim/non-Turk you have to pay 25 euros to even take a peek inside, and even then you can only visit the upper gallery, not the main floor. Muslims/Turks can visit the main floor for free and have a look inside. They pay 25 euros only if they really want to see the upper gallery (completely unnecessary to do so).",514,2024-04-16 19:34:54,James-Pond197,0.79

I had an email from [going.com](https://going.com) about cheap tickets to NZ - I jumped on it purchased the tickets through chase travel rewards and booked a car rental as well. I am a seasoned traveler ( or so I considered myself ) the trip was a few weeks away and we had 3 trips to complete before going to NZ. So I let it sit on the back burner. Fast forward to the day we are supposed to head to NZ- head to LAX from our city and at the airport in LAX I realize we need a visa to go to NZ. Not once did i bother to check. I had spoken to my friends that are from NZ living in the US now and a few friends that had traveled to NZ and no one mentioned a visa. Frantic I run to the delta help desk and they said it happens all the time NOT to worry it should be approved within 10-20 min and given our flight didn't leave for another 2 hours we should be okay. Well it was not approved in time, it took 4 days for me to get my visa. We changed our flights through the app ( bad idea) and called the rental company to change our travel dates for another time. A few days ago Delta canceled our tickets as no show and the car rental company didn't refund the original rental purchase. Needless to say this trip to NZ ( that we have not even traveled to) has turned into the MOST expensive trip to date. Org tickets were $650 for premium economy now they are over $2000. I cant help but to laugh bc otherwise I would cry.

They were approached by a seemingly kind young man on a beach (I think) who started chatting with them. They were invited back to this man‚Äôs house and went. I believe it was a short walk to get there. They sent me pictures of this man posing with his entire family: siblings, a few young kids, grandma, mom etc. they clearly don‚Äôt have a lot, shack house with dirt floor, mom&amp; grandma sell fruit to bus drivers to make a living etc. They were showing them the herbs/plants they grow and use for medicine etc. My parents and their friends gave them $200 USD and told us ‚Äúwe feel like we‚Äôre best friends with them‚Äù We love them so much, they‚Äôre so kind etc. 
 
Then they tell us that this young man is going to pick them up today and drive them 40 minutes to a nice golf course where he can get them 1/2 price entry so my dad and his friend can golf and my mom and her friend can relax at a nearby resort. 

Red flags are going off everywhere in my head because I know Central America does not have a reputation for being all that safe but everyone tells me Roatan is a great place. If these people are trying to swoon my parents and their friends for money, or worse etc then they were shown just how easy of targets they are (willing to come to the home, willingly giving money etc) 

Of course I can‚Äôt help but think of the worst case scenario. Them getting kidnapped, held for ransom, robbed, etc. why do they want to split up the men and the women? Don‚Äôt really know what to do‚Ä¶ I told them not to be so trusting but they‚Äôre adamant this young man and his family ‚Äúare legit‚Äù
Half of me is saying ‚Äúthis is totally fine, everything will be okay!‚Äù

Thoughts?! 

*UPDATE #1* My mom told me they got to the golf course / resort and everything is fine, they like the guy in question. They paid the guy $70 per couple to get them there, 45 min drive. I guess the guy wasn‚Äôt clear with them on whether this $ included the drive back, that makes me kinda wonder if he‚Äôll want a lot more for the trip back. He also got my dad and his friend into the course for $100 (likely 9 holes, my dad hardly does a full 18 anymore at 69 years old) but from what I‚Äôm finding online this would have been much much cheaper had they booked this little excursion independently. Sounds like they‚Äôre getting ripped off when it comes down to it but doesn‚Äôt sound like they‚Äôre in danger. I will post a second update when I hear back from them later tonight when (hopefully) they make it back to their main hotel. Thank you so much everyone for all the advice and lookin‚Äô out! I‚Äôm glad to know I wasn‚Äôt overreacting.. 

*UPDATE #2* They made it back to the hotel they‚Äôre staying at! YAY! Such a sigh of relief for me. Sounds like this young man wanted more money, but my dad negotiated out a very reasonable price. He was always kind with them and they got back with no problems. Overall, it was my rich American parents helping out a local with some extra cash and my parents actually did enjoy their experience. I feel a little bad for kinda freaking out, but would rather be safe than sorry. I can‚Äôt thank everyone enough for all the advice and comments.

1g5msax,Some lessons I learned travelling as light as possible,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g5msax/some_lessons_i_learned_travelling_as_light_as/,593,"Hi everyone, 

I'm from Europe and as most of you are probably aware our extreme low cost airlines over the years got more and more extreme with their restrictions about ""included hand luggage"" (aka ""free personal item"" that's included with Ryanair, Wizz, Easyjet etc.). At the moment it can only be one piece with the max. measures of 40x20x25cm which is a small (15-ish liters) daypack. 

For the past 15 years now I made it my ""hobby"" to travel only with free hand luggage and the more the airlines restricted the more I got rid of ""unneccessary"" things when I travel. Reason is that I mostly don't stay in one location but travel to different cities/areas when I go to another country and I really do not want to do this with luggage. Plus the saved money is a nice extra. 

At the moment I travel with a 13l backpack similar to Vaude Coreway 10 but a little bigger. I also always leave some room for souvenirs so my backpack isn't completely full when I fly out.

Some lessons I learned about going lighter: 

* on almost every trip you bring something unneccessary. Make (mental) notes about which items you did not use once (or could at least not have used once) and leave it home next time (this rule excludes medi kit)
* When booking accomodation, have a look at what they offer and choose one that allows you to leave towels, hair dryer, shampoo etc. at home. 
* Solid body wash/shampoo bars &gt; liquid 
* There is a mini ""travel"" version of almost every product. Don't bring full-size anything to a 5 day trip. 
* If you REALLY lack something neccessary, most things can be bought for little money so don't stress out beforehand too much. 
* If you travel for more than a week, coin laundries are your friend (I usually travel with clothes for 5 days and then wash)
* don't pack complete outfits but clothes you can combine in different ways (depending on how cold/warm and the occasion). As a woman, tights and shorts are your friend - minimal weight/volume. 
* You can wear pants more than once. When you go hiking in the wilderness or in a cool place where you not sweat a lot you can also wear shirts more than once. That's perfectly acceptable and not ""gross"" at all. I really had to learn that because at home I go through my clothes like they go out of fashion. 
* stuff sacks are bullshit because you can't properly pack orbs in a backpack. But compression bags (rectangular, making your folded clothes flatter) are the shit. 
* Shawls are practical because they double as some sort of poncho in chilly nights, as a small blanket, a headscraf or even a belt or some fashion accessoire 
* Always wear the bulkiest clothes you have with you to the airport

Some lessons I learned about trying to go too light

* always take your good walking/hiking shoes with you even if they are bulky as hell
* a good waterproof jacket must be part of the luggage, no matter if the destination is sunny and warm
* never compromise about the medi kit. Do not try to make it smaller, you will 100% need the single med you decided to unpack
* Even if you're not into swimming/the beach it won't hurt to bring a bikini that can double as additional pair of underwear if not needed for swimming

I've recently traveled to Germany and rented a car from Sixt.

When signing the rental agreement, I've added the smart protection which covers everything in case of an accident. The employee at the counter told me and my friend who rented the car with me, that in case of any damage done to the car, even in case of a total-loss, we wouldn't have to worry about anything.

Fast forward a few days into the trip, we slipped into the barrier on one of the highway interchanges. Nobody was hurt nor any damage was done besides to the car. We got stressed and anxious and continued driving the car.

We immediately drove straight into the closest Sixt branch and told them everything, where they told us that everything is perfectly fine as long as we purchased the full coverage, which we have.

They gave us an alternative car and had it until the end of our trip.

When we arrived back home, they sent me some emails about the damage and how it was done, so I told them.

Now, they have sent me an email where they demand approximately 33,000‚Ç¨ to be paid in 2 weeks. They also mentioned that they decided not to cover the damage because we didn't call the police as it violates their terms and conditions.

What are your thoughts?

Edit: 
The car was not totaled at all, we drove it perfectly fine and straight after the incident.
The sum is high but still astronomical compared to the damage done. The car is an Audi A5.

1878494,The reality of Cartagena.,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1878494/the_reality_of_cartagena/,587,"Hi there. I'm from Medellin, Colombia, but I travel a lot and I've been thinking about doing a post about Cartagena, as I think many people need to know the reality.

What made me want to do it today was the recent post where a guy talks about his trip through Latin America and how he was robbed in Cartagena.

I would just like you to know that Cartagena is an absolutely spectacular city, I have been to every continent and over 30 countries and I still think Cartagena, in terms of beauty, is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but I think it is not worth visiting unless you are up for a very rough and perhaps disappointing experience, and here is why:

The basis of Cartagena's problem is that it has the most corrupt politicians in Colombia, there is so much corruption that there are only very rich or extremely poor people in Cartagena. Of course, there are exceptions, but visiting Cartagena you can see the inequality if you go outside the historic center.

Precisely because of this inequality, there are so many people trying to make you buy something from them, every three seconds (I swear, this is not an exaggeration), they will have sellers trying to sell anything; sometimes aggressively. 

What you will not realize unless it is too late, is that many people in Cartagena have created extremely sophisticated strategies to make you pay a lot more than what things cost, especially if you look like a foreigner.

And I'm not talking about a bottle of water costing them $5 when it should cost $1, I'm talking about, almost every day in the Colombian news, we see several foreigners being offered shrimp on the beach, or a massage at a spa center, or a dinner at a restaurant that looks legit, and then their bill goes up to over USD $1500 for some reason the vendors claim. And because there is so much corruption, almost all the police can be bought, which means that these vendors already know the cops and promise them a cut of the money, so the police will be against you.

I teach Spanish as a foreign language, and all of my students have come back incredibly disappointed from their trip to Cartagena. It is still amazing to me how it remains such a popular destination. Just yesterday, my student from Canada came back from Cartagena and told me that the first night he was walking back to his hotel and two policemen (yes, two policemen) robbed him. 

Again, I do think that Cartagena is, architecturally, the most beautiful city in Colombia, but the experience is so terrible that it doesn't end up being what anyone expects. I'm sure there are many exceptions and that it is possible to have an amazing time in Cartagena, but if you are planning a trip to this city, please be aware of the things I say.",214,2023-11-29 21:04:38,[deleted],0.96

1f4qx2n,Unpopular opinion: booking.com is great,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f4qx2n/unpopular_opinion_bookingcom_is_great/,578,"Hey guys,

I have read so many negative posts and comments on [booking.com](http://booking.com) on here that today, after a really great experience with them, I wanted to share a different view. (And just before anyone asks: NO, I am not a bot, I do not work for them, I do not have anything to gain from them by posting this.)

For background: my partner and I have been using [booking.com](http://booking.com) exclusively for the past two+ years (approx 30  hotel reservations in that time). Thanks to that, we have 'genius level 3' which affords us with discounts as well as 'priority assistance' by support.

Today we had to contact them via phone regarding two issues (no wait time on hotline):  
  
1) for a booking that we made and  cancelled within the cancellation period. Despite us receiving a cancellation confirmation via eMail, the full price was deducted from our credit card.   
Solution: while on the phone with us, the support agent called the safari lodge in South Africa and they confirmed they would be refunding our money immediately.

2) another safari accommodation we booked and where the deposit was automatically taken off our credit card via [booking.com](http://booking.com) contacted us via eMail to finalise the full payment. We were unsure if this is a scam or a possible risk of money being paid twice, once from us directly and then again via bookingcom from our credit card.  
Solution: bookingcom agent confirmed this was legit from the lodging, it was a very highly rated and trustworthy company and we can pay them directly with peace of mind.

  
So yeah, while I understand and commiserate people have had bad experiences, I also wanted to point out that it is not all bad.   
Of course, I would not book flights on that website (or other third parties), so my experience is only around accommodation booking.",324,2024-08-30 04:23:05,adventu_Rena,0.75

1dl96in,Lost laptop during TSA check. Advice welcome!,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dl96in/lost_laptop_during_tsa_check_advice_welcome/,580,"I went through a TSA check yesterday before a flight, and my MacBook Air was missing when I went to retrieve it from a bin. There was a different unaccounted for laptop, so it may have been that someone mistakenly took it. I immediately told TSA and filed a police report. After exhausting my other options, I remembered to check Find My, but my flight was leaving, and I didn‚Äôt have time to search the area where it was showing up in the airport. Police did very little even when I told them the area where it was in the airport, though I suspect that‚Äôs for good legal reasons.

Anyway, the laptop now is in the Philippines. It is now somewhere near Carmen in the Davao del Norte Province. Is there anything I can do to get TSA, DOT, or police to review footage to determine who took the laptop? Is there anything I can do to try to get my laptop back other than relying on the person with it to text my number? (I‚Äôve placed the laptop on lost mode.)

Thank you.

Edit: I‚Äôve appreciated reading a bunch of your responses. Even when writing this post, I don‚Äôt think that I expected to be able to find a way to retrieve my laptop, but at least thinking about possible solutions and reading what everyone has said has helped me process a lot of the anger I was feeling and find peace.

1cy8s89,Beware of fake booking.com listings (I was scammed in London) ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cy8s89/beware_of_fake_bookingcom_listings_i_was_scammed/,573,"I booked a say in an apartmenr through booking.com, it was nonrefundable but it was a decent price for Mayfair, London (2000¬£ for 4 nights) and looked very nice. I was booking quite last minute so I booked it without much thought as I have only had positive experiences with booking apartments. 

The day before my check in I received a message that I have to PayPal the host 1500¬£ as a safety deposit to receive the address - this seemed very sketchy. Then I found the photos listed again but this time as a different apartment and different location - I knew I was being scammed!

I called the customer support and that was the worst experience ever because after speaking to 3 different people and a manager, I was told to pay the PayPal fee outside of booking as they believe it is real and as I agreed to the property policy by booking with this host! I informed them about the duplicate listings and if they can guarantee the paypal money if I don‚Äôt receive the address, they said they can‚Äôt guarantee that! Booking told me that if I don‚Äôt PayPal the money to the host I won‚Äôt even get a refund form booking. 

So I paid the fee and hoped to receive the address, guess what, I didn‚Äôt get anything despite repeatedly reaching out to the host. 

I called my local booking support not their international one (never call the international support they are incompetent), my local support said these scams happen every day now and they called the host. The customer support guy said the scammer was screaming at them and was hysterical and rude for being exposed. I received my PayPal and booking money but stayed in the center of London without a place to stay.

I love staying at apartments but with booking and airbnb scams happening every day, I have to recommend everyone to stay in hotels until booking.com manages to put better anti-scam policies into place. I was lucky my local support helped me, the international support basically just kept repeating - ‚Äúno worries mam we think the listing is real, we can‚Äôt help you‚Äù 

Another scam I found is a villa in st tropez, which after reverse image searching on google is a famous villa in Corsica! This was 2000‚Ç¨ per night and after filling out multiple reports it is still online.

For those who don‚Äôt know, the cartels are committing acts of terrorism. Armed gunmen broke into a live news broadcast and held the anchors hostage on air. A bomb has gone off in Quito and there is rioting all around the cities. Prisons have been taken control by the gangs and they have live-streamed executing guards.
The army has been deployed to quell the violence. 

My wife and I were supposed to fly into Quito this Saturday and fly to the Gal√°pagos Islands on Monday morning. I know the islands are safe and we would like to still go. But I don‚Äôt know if the army will make things safe enough to stay in Quito for those two nights. My question is does the situation look like it is improving?

UPDATE: Thank you all for commenting and giving me your opinions. Many suggested we cancel our trip, but after careful consideration and speaking with people in Quito, we decided to continue our trip as planned. We just spent our first day in Quito and had a lovely time drinking wine with some locals at the equator. Tomorrow we fly to the Galapagos.

There is always an inherent risk when it comes to traveling. Speaking to locals put my mind more at ease as they had advised things has significantly calmed down in the last few days. When I first posted, the situation was very unpredictable. For those stuck between cancelling there trip, I would recommend a wait and see approach. Reach out to the locals before your trip to get the most accurate advise.

A Solo Traveler‚Äôs Experience",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fst66x/if_you_can_handle_india_can_you_handle_egypt_a/,567,"I‚Äôm a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals‚Äîsometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.

Of course, it wasn‚Äôt all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn‚Äôt very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.

When I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident‚ÄîI thought, ‚ÄúIf I handled India, Egypt shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.‚Äù I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I‚Äôm no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.

However, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant‚Äîfrom street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn‚Äôt escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I‚Äôd be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.

The harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt‚Äôs history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There‚Äôs so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you‚Äôll always discover something new. It‚Äôs truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.

In conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don‚Äôt let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",160,2024-09-30 06:25:22,FinerThingsInHanoi,0.93

1gcgaii,Boarding denied: Barcelona to Dublin,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gcgaii/boarding_denied_barcelona_to_dublin/,563,"Well, writing this from the BCN airport.

Had an early morning flight today to DUB from BCN by Vueling. Boarding was denied at gate claiming no valid documents to travel. It was a birthday vacation with wife (birthday tomorrow). 9 days were planned across Ireland starting today until Nov 3rd.

We hold Indian passports, reside in Barcelona with Spanish Residence Permit. Good travel history with over 30 countries across 4 continents, valid US, UK visas in addition to the Spanish residence permit.

We were travelling to Ireland under Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme (SSVWP) which allows Indian passport holders to visit Ireland without Irish visa if I have a valid short stay UK visa and I have entered UK in the last 180 days. Our exit from Ireland has to be either before UK visa expires or the UK entry permission of 180 days expires, whichever is the earlier. My UK visa is not issued in India, hence it's not a BIVS visa which gives entry to both UK and Ireland. But the Irish SSVWP is applicable for the UK visa I hold.

Coming to the current incident, flight was at 5:40 in the morning, we left our home at 1:00am, reached airport at 3:00am. Our boarding pass was issued, UK visa was verified, we checked in a bag and no drama while issuing the boarding pass. Fast forward to 5:00am while we were boarding, I unfortunately met one of the worst behavioured and unprofessional dumbass at boarding gate. She claimed that I need Irish Visa to travel to Dublin. I explained her the case, but she was very negligent and not interested to listen. She called her ""so called boss"" and asked if she can allow us and we are travelling with UK visa and apparently her boss said no. Meanwhile I kept telling her it's not just UK visa, but with entry stamp of UK within last 180 days. She never heard and just kept saying no. I even had the mail from Irish Embassy in Madrid stating that I can travel to Ireland. The rule exists in Irish govt website and IATA travel center website as well. She was just saying no to everything and was behaving as if she has the final say. I requested to talk to her boss to which she denied. She even rejected my request to give it in writing. She wasn't even listening to my case, she started shouting ""no""  in the very beginning if I even try to talk. I wasn't even sure on next steps or how to go back as I will have to cancel my exit immigration. I tried asking that, the moment I opened my mouth, she started shouting ""no, you need a visa."" She called the security and then we were escorted out of the boarding area, through immigration to the arrival area.

As it was early morning, no customer center was open. I went to the check-in counter and found a representative of Vueling, who looked like manager of the people who handle check-in. I explained him our case of denied boarding, he took us to a check-in counter where they called Dublin airport (I assume Irish immigration officials in Dublin airport) and explained the case. On receiving the confirmation that we can travel, he rebooked us on a flight later in the evening. He told us that he has entered the message in the system under our booking so that people at boarding gate will know our case.

Post this, we went back to the arrivals area where our checked-in bag was lying on the belt, collected it and came back to check-in the bag again in about 20mins. Guess what, repeat of same story. It was some other stupid employee in the check-in counter this time, rejected to check us in saying we need Irish visa. I explained her the story, we were just denied, it's your colleague who rebooked us just couple of minutes ago, he has entered the message in system against our booking, we are travelling with visa waiver, but all she was saying is that I need Irish visa. I lost the patience this time and just shouted at her to go home if you do not know the rules and are not interested in working. Thankfully found that person who rebooked my tickets, and he told her our case and we are checked-in now. 8 more hours to kill in the airport before the flight and I am still not confident that we will be allowed to board in the evening flight. He has told me that he will inform the necessary people and assured us that we will fly. Sitting at the airport, just with hopes as only the time will answer.

We had our train booked to Galway from Dublin today afternoon which we will miss, will have to figure out our last moment stay now in Dublin. I am skeptical of booking this even now as I am not confident that they will allow us to board in the evening.

All Vueling has given us is a rebooking on a flight 13hrs later, meal vouchers worth 40 euros per person. I would like to know from the travel community - what are the rights I have here and whom do I reach out for compensation? I have raised the compensation request with Vueling through the app already, but I definitely dont want to settle here for something small. In addition to the waste of train tickets, a night stay in Galway, I will have to book a last moment stay in Dublin and all the stress and harassment. Plus I lost a day of my trip.

TLDR; zero knowledge employee at boarding gate denied us from boarding the flight. We are at the receiving end, sleep deprived us, wasting time from 3am at airport and now waiting for the rebooked flight at 6:30pm in a hope that they will allow to board.


UPDATE: Boarded the evening flight, reached Dublin, cleared immigration in less than a minute, took the bus straight to Galway, reached our stay at 1am and straight away crashed on bed. Thanks all for the help and inputs.",145,2024-10-26 03:15:23,random_alma,0.88

My height is aggressively average (5'9) and my knees were consistently banging against the seat in front of me. Seat padding was nearly non-existent and the tray tables are tiny. Any movement I made risked me bumping into my seat mate or bumping into the seat in front of me. Economy class was never *comfortable* but it was never this uncomfortable either.

I had a similar experience on United's 787, and Virgin's A350. Comparatively, Air India although terrible in every other way had significantly more spacious seats on their 777s, but this could be attributed to the fact that the cabin hasn't been refurbished since 2008. The newer planes may be more technologically advanced but are configured waaay more cramped than older planes are/were.

It just feels that the economy class experience is past the tipping point with airlines cramming as many people as possible while toeing the line at what feels humane. Meals are also smaller, with some airlines completely eliminating 2nd hot meals on longer flights. Delays are commonplace. Service is poorer. We're getting nickled and dimed everywhere from paying for seats to luggage. Yet prices are currently VERY high relative to what it was pre 2020.

I miss economy travel of the 90s and 2000s where I looked forward to flying and being treated well. Nowadays I can't wait to get off the plane the moment I board.",240,2024-01-04 12:23:04,FrankBeamer_,0.92
18b7pn6,Dead Sea - raw sewage,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18b7pn6/dead_sea_raw_sewage/,562,"The first time I visited Israel/The West Bank and Jordan. I fully planned on going to the mud baths of the Dead Sea. I had a tour guide from East Jerusalem. He told me no one he knows goes to the mud baths except tourists and let me in on a not so well kept secret- millions of gallons of raw untreated sewage flows into the Dead Sea from East Jerusalem and parts of Jordan every single day. As I read more bout it .. well we cancelled those plans. It was even in National Geographic! ü§Æ 

The River of feces flows through the Kidron valley and towns on the river have been complaining for years of the putrid stench. 

That‚Äôs millions of lbs of human waste. ‚Ä¶. And you are swimming in it and rubbing it all over your face. 

Why don‚Äôt more people who visit know about this? Is the tourism lobby that strong? Major companies that make millions in Dead Sea salt, dead sea mud, etc. 

It‚Äôs in newspapers all over Israel and Jordan. They have been fighting about the waste treatment for over 20 years. 

Something to think about before you buy that  Dead Sea mud or er manure for your face.

1ev7cfb,Countries with the best coffee/cafe culture?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ev7cfb/countries_with_the_best_coffeecafe_culture/,557,"Which countries have you been where the locals live and breathe coffee? 

I'm talking about good coffee **and** good cafe culture

The top 3 that come to mind are:

**Vietnam** - Seems like every 2 shops is a cafe. People drink it in the morning, afternoon and night. It's very common to see the whole family hang out at night sipping on a vietnamese coffee while people watching on the sidewalk. The newer cafes have really good decor and ambience.

**Melbourne** - Very rare to get a bad coffee. I would argue that if the cafe serves bad coffee, then they will go out of business. Even the coffee at McDonalds is good. 

**Italy** - Very common to see locals standing at these expresso bars at stations and cafes just sipping on 1euro expressos. They are sooooo good and love the old school look at some of these cafes.

Honourable mentions: Peru (consistently good everywhere), Colombia (especially the towns) and Kona in Hawaii. These places have really good coffee although I don't think the cafe culture is that strong.

I'm curious as to what you guys think, I would like to add to my travel list!

Look it up, it's basically this short 5-minute tourist trap light show tram thing that takes you across the Huangpu River from the Bund to Pudong, with bizarre voice-overs. Sort of like some Disney attraction, but sadder, the very epitome of a kitsch tourist trap.

The tunnel was built and opened in around 2010 (for Shanghai's World Expo), along with the China Pavilion. And given the futuristic theme of the whole spectacle, it's one of those things that would make you cringe out loud and think, ""damn, we *totally* got the future wrong"".

And you know, I genuinely liked it. I went on it both ways when I was around 8, and I have fond memories of riding it with my family (well, I have fond memories of Shanghai and China in general). And I don't know if that makes me some immature manchild or something, but if I got to ride that little slow car in that glowy tunnel again now, I'd still love it, and definitely even feel a bit nostalgic about it.

Anyway, my first pick pocket incident was in Paris last year whilst walking through the metro with my gf. I felt someone else rubbing up besides me which was unusual because there was heaps of space in the tunnel leading outdoors (even my gf was not that physically close to me). I realised instantly this guy was trying to pickpocket so I made a massive scene and swore at him and he scurried off calling me crazy. 

4 days ago in Brussels, I was outside the metro wearing the same cross body bag behind me (one year later, it‚Äôs a bit broken so it‚Äôs harder to actually open - the zipper catches every so often and needs to be fiddled around with).  I was very sweaty and distracted because I was dragging very heavy luggages. I felt something catch my body bag. My gf also turned around at the same time because she felt bad I was struggling with the luggage. We both noticed someone behind me with their arm extended and hat ontop of my cross body bag. As we turned around, he removed his hat off my bag and walked slower to allow his female friend to catch up to him,  they turned a corner and walked off. Quickly, I checked my bag and noticed it was a quarter to half open however nothing was missing. I was so slow this time (post 3 day camping festival) and didn‚Äôt realise I was being pickpocketed so unable to start a scene. I‚Äôm so lucky the bag was kinda broken and caught half way and my gf turning around, otherwise I could have lost my wallet, cards and cash.

Stay safe out there people. Pick pocketers everywhere in Europe. Key theme here inc. commonly occurring in and around metro stations. They will target your cross body bag!

These people mean well, and aren‚Äôt telling you something like ‚ÄúTravel with a sign saying ‚ÄòRob me,‚Äô‚Äùbut the advice can still come up short. Oftentimes, I see people saying that when you‚Äôre visiting a city, you should spend at least a few days there in order to get the vibe. This is great until you realize that time and budgets are limited for a lot of people, and that their big trip might be once every five years, or ten years, or even their entire life! Despite this, you see people treating the idea that you're not *really* experiencing a place if you don‚Äôt spend at least three days there as gospel, especially on Reddit. The fact of the matter is, if you only have one shot to go to Europe, it‚Äôs probably a better bet to do two days in Florence and two in Rome rather than four in Rome- who knows if you‚Äôre ever going to see Florence again? 

Likewise, working the opposite direction, money-wise, are people who recommend upcoming or less-expensive destinations as a *replacement* for more popular/expensive places. This isn‚Äôt to say that recommending these places is a bad idea whatsoever, and indeed, some of them are favorites and better than the big ticket destinations, but the experience of having a coastal holiday in Montenegro is fundamentally not the same as the French Riviera. London might be profoundly expensive, but it‚Äôs also the only one there is, and saying ‚ÄúJust to to Georgia/Thailand/Spain‚Äù or whatever place people love to promote doesn‚Äôt change the fact if you want to see Big Ben or the British Museum, there‚Äôs only once place you can see them.

Once everyone was onboard and situated, the FA brought someone over from another seat to the open aisle seat next to him in the exit row.

My friend describes the guy as a ""conservative 350-400lbs"", and he apparently pulled up the armrest without asking as soon as he sat down, and my buddy said that this person took over about half his seat.  

He said he toughed it out for about 45 minutes and then called for the FA and asked to be moved.  The big guy supposedly acted all offended.  My buddy said that he himself was calm and respectful about it, but I have known him to be a bit of an arguer in the past, and I am betting he was a bit steamed about the situation (not sure, though).

Anyway, they eventually reseated the big guy and my buddy thought that was the end of it.

He got an email from someone in the FAA about an investigation into this, and at first he didn't remember because this was 6 months ago.  The email just asked his side on the situation, so he replied with what I just wrote above.  

There was no talking to from the airline or security, and no documentation/contact from anyone after the flight, and he has flown on the same airline half a dozen times since then, and nothing else until this email.

What could they be looking for with an investigation?  Again, I can see my buddy expressing some frustration with the big guy if he gave him some attitude, or even with the FA if she wasn't helpful.  It still doesn't seem to have reached a level of involving others or being super disrespectful or anything, so I am just wondering exactly what may happen.

1czv98a,Safety Tip: Seat Belts on Commercial Airliners,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1czv98a/safety_tip_seat_belts_on_commercial_airliners/,542,"Given some incidents that have been in the news lately regarding turbulence, I think it would to give some safety tips about seat belts to all the travelers out when they're traveling via commercial airplanes. 

I'm a very frequent traveler, with over 1 million lifetime miles on United Airlines, and I've been to all seven continents. I'm also an accomplished skydiver, with over 2,000 skydives and a world record (largest group jump at night). 

So if there's two things I know, it's sitting on airplanes for long periods of time, and jumping out of them. 

I also often travel with my parachute. But when things get bumpy, I'm not reaching for my parachute in the overhead, I'm making sure my seat belt is on. In fact, on a commercial flight a parachute is utterly useless. I can't think of a single incident in the past 40 years where a parachute in the cabin would have saved a person. It's about as useful as a bag of laundry. Expensive laundry. (I only travel with a parachute because I'm going somewhere to skydive.)

So seatbelts.

We're told over and over (and over, and over) on flights to keep our seat belts fastened. It's easy to drown it out. Many of us on this subreddit can give the safety briefing we've heard it so many, many times. 

But... Seatbelts are probably the *most important safety device we can use on an airplane*. You would think perhaps that a parachute would be great, but as I said, it's useless. The seat belt is *golden*. And that's true for all stages of flight (taxi, takeoff, cruise, approach, landing, taxi). 

We tend to think of as airplane seatbelts like we think about car seatbelts keeping us inside a car in case of a crash. So often people don't think they're needed outside of takeoff and landing. But they serve more purpose than that (even in cars). They keep us from bouncing around inside the cabin if things get really bumpy. 

There's been some news reports lately about turbulence affecting airplanes, including sadly a recent fatality. Severe turbulence incidents do happen and while they're rare enough that in 1.5 million miles I've never had one, they're not impossible. They do happen. It's only now being reported more often now because more attention is being paid to aviation because of the Boeing debacle. That's how news cycles work.

A seatbelt is the best thing in those situations. It's not just for taxi, takeoff, and landing (though you should wear it those times too). 

I've jumped from hot air balloons, a passenger jet (out the rear door of a skydiving-equipped DC-9 like DB cooper), and out of helicopters. And I wear my seat belt on the airplane at any time I'm in my seat (except getting up to go to the bathroom). I don't let it prevent me from getting up to go to the bathroom or grab a snack of the galley on a long haul, but if my butt is in a seat my seat belt is on.

We wear seatbelts for more reasons than you'd might think. Part of your seat belt is for me, part of my seat belt is for you.

If I'm wearing my seatbelt and you're sitting next to me and you're not, if we hit severe turbulence you're way more likely to hurt me than me hurting you.

Watch this: https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/bqr1mu/wear_your_seatbelt/

The person without the seatbelt absolutely clobbered the one wearing a seatbelt.

Fortunately in 1.5 million miles on United (and other airlines) there's never been an incident like that, but I still wear it at all times when I'm sitting down.

So buckle up and happy flying.",175,2024-05-24 16:02:28,shadeland,0.8
1cbbdlr,My experience as an American in Federal Iraq &amp; Kurdistan,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cbbdlr/my_experience_as_an_american_in_federal_iraq/,543,"I just returned from 10 days in Iraq: Baghdad, Babylon, Najaf, Karbala, Nasiriya, Samarra, Mosul and Erbil. I'm a 36-year-old American, who went with a small group of other Americans around my age (mostly women), along with a Brit and Australian. 

**Impressions:**  
I recognize this sounds naive, but Iraq was one of the safest countries I've ever visted. Though most of my trip was with my group that included an Iraqi driver, and Iraqi and American guides, I did wander by myself through the heart of Baghdad and Erbil (in Kurdistan). At no point was I ever concerned about my safety. The biggest threat posed was the growing crowds that formed as Iraqis heard me speak basic Arabic, and began taking selfies with me. 

It did give me a new perspective on the security situation however in Iraq. I was there when Iran launched drones to Israel, in fact they flew over my hotel in Karbala (a holy city for Shia muslims). The country is torn between Iran and the West. Missiles are launched at, from and over Iraq. And although we see reports on the news of this, the impression in the West is the country is still consumed by conflict and war. However, they affect a very small part of the population, usually in remote desert areas and on the outskirts of large cities like Baghdad and Mosul. 

Checkpoints run by Iran-backed Shia militias are common, but usually it's a quick flash of your passport. And you move on. Most Iraqis are pretty moderate. 60 percent of the country is under the age of 25. Most have no, or few memories, of  Saddam or the 2003 US invasion. The effects of the country's civil war and ISIS are still very fresh however, including in Mosul's currently-rebuilding old city. Many young Iraqi's I met drink, date, play Call of Duty, and browse Instagram and Tiktok. Many educated young Iraqis speak English very well. Many Shia muslims do not support Iran, despite the country being majority Shia. Though Iran has thoroughly inserted itself into Iraq's military and parliment. 

Most Iraqis were curious why I was visiting their country, and very friendly. I was constantly offered free things which I did my best to turn down and pay for. The country has a rich ancient history that is onpar with anything in Egypt, Greece or Italy, with basically zero crowds or even other tourists. 

I wouldn't say the food is very sophisticated. It can feel kabob- and falafel-centered. But it is generally good, and they enjoy other nearby cuisines from countries like Syria. You can also find some western food, especially up north in Erbil.

If you're interested in Iraq, give it a shot. Do a group trip to help with the language, logistics, and checkpoint experiences. But, I do not regret it, and it's miles better than my experience elsewhere in the Mideast including Saudi. ",184,2024-04-23 13:04:32,sdo2020,0.89

1f8ugxr,"Italy, June 2024",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f8ugxr,519,"Yet another Italy review/dump, please bear with me 
- We were there for 12 whole days and we covered Venice, Florence, Naples, Amalfi (and surroundings) and finally Rome. We had Pisa in the itinerary as well but couldn't do it because of the time constraints.
- Firstly Italy lived up to its hype, great sites , great hospitable people and a Lott of things to do overall 
- Favourite part was Amalfi coast and the surrounding parts (Sorrento, Positano etc). The heat was brutal but it was great nonetheless.
- The museums in Florence were amazing. The city in general was great! 

- Venice was way too crowded. Did a bunch of touristy things and it was decent but as soon as the sun set , the city just became much more magical and thus more enjoyable. 
- We found Florence to be a tad bit expensive, atleast the restaurants and a few museums(compared to other cities). Had the worst pizza here opposite Cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore. Our fault lol shouldn't have gone to a tourist trap.
- The Gelatos were absolutely amazing had way too many lol. The cafes were nice as well

- I'd read a lot of unpleasant things about Naples but most of them turned out to be not true. Yes the city seems to be run down and kinda dirty but I never felt unsafe. The pizza was ofc amazing, but the main issue was the public transport or the lack thereof. We had to walk long long distances everywhere. The buses weren't frequent enough, I had to wait 30 mins to an hour for the bus.
- Then came to Rome,  we brutally underestimated the Italian summer lol it was 33¬∞C. Rome is a walkable city sure but the sites are spreadout and you'll have to walk longish distances under the brutal heat, please take care. The sites were breathtaking and the cafes were great as well.
- We saw 3 pickpocket incidents in the Rome metro . Those pickpocketters were so fkn skilled, it was super scary. They looked young and east Europian, they also seemed to work in teams. She was confronted once by a local and she started screaming and created a huge scene out of it. Be careful if you're using a  mobile inside the metro.
- We also went on a food tour and would definitely recommend it

One last thing, I'm not sure why but the public transport times shown in Google maps and in IRL almost never matched. There was a significant difference in the times shown in the app and the bus/tram arrivals. This was seen in almost all cities, not sure who is to blame here, the Google map APIs or the local transport orgs that were sending the wrong data.

196b7bc,What I wish I knew before going to Argentina,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/196b7bc/what_i_wish_i_knew_before_going_to_argentina/,490,"I spent two months (October - December 2023) travelling Argentina alone as a young woman and these are the things I wish I had known before going. 


1. Even with intermediate or near advanced level Spanish, the accents over there are very difficult to understand. I found this to be especially true in the city of Buenos Aires, Salta and Jujuy. It got slightly easier after two months of exposure.

2. Don‚Äôt go into a taxi without a meter or without a set price beforehand. Unfortunately there are a lot of corrupt taxi drivers trying to rip you off. That was actually the worst part of my trip. Uber is usually the cheaper option however it was only available for me in the capital and Cordoba.

3. Spend more time outside of the city of Cordoba to explore the Traslasierra and Calamuchita Valley regions. People may disagree but I found the city of Cordoba to be quite dull. I would have instead stayed a night or two in the city and the rest out in those regions. As for the people (the cordobeses), they were absolutely wonderful!

4. Don‚Äôt rely too much on your debit/credit card. When I went the visa/Mastercard tourist rate was close to the blue dollar rate which was great but not everyone accepts foreign cards. On top of that the connection won‚Äôt always be good in certain places. It‚Äôs best to always bring cash with you.

5. Spend a night in one of the mountain refuges in the Patagonia region. There were some incredible refuges in El Bols√≥n and Bariloche. Many were equipped with food and beverages in case you wanted to buy something.

6. Tipping 10%-15% is customary. I wasn‚Äôt aware of this and didn‚Äôt do it the first time (I come from a country where tipping culture isn‚Äôt a thing) I went out for dinner. I felt really bad afterwards.

7. Bariloche, El Chalt√©n and El Calafate are 2-3x more expensive than Buenos Aires. I haven‚Äôt been to Ushuaia or San Mart√≠n de Los Andes but I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs the same. 

8. Inflation is very high. In a matter of days things will increase by 100-500 pesos. 

9. Don‚Äôt be so fearful. I spent two months travelling around Argentina as a young woman on her own and I was totally fine. If you are well-prepared (did research on where to go, how to get money) and take basic safety precautions, you will most likely be fine. I never felt unsafe but I also didn‚Äôt do anything reckless or stupid. 

I really enjoyed my trip in Argentina. It‚Äôs a country of remarkable beauty and diversity. And despite the adversities they face, the argentines are the some of the friendliest people I‚Äôve met.

Edit: Also, I used a Claro prepaid physical SIM card (very affordable). You have to activate the SIM card at an actual Claro store but you can top up at any kiosk. I wanted to use an esim but I found that most of the affordable esims didn‚Äôt offer enough data (6GB max). You are going to need more data than you think. Wifi is going not going to work everywhere.

I left the pool and walked back into the villa and there is a couple standing in our villa. They realise they are in the wrong villa and are very apologetic about their mistake. They say that they forgot their key, they got their villa number wrong and that the hotel staff opened the door for them.

Nobody else can access the pool or any other part of the villa (except in this case, when hotel staff opened the villa doors for guests who said they forgot their key).

The main bedroom where the kid was asleep has double doors that open onto the pool where we were. The kid was literally 2 meters away from where we were in the pool. If the kid cried, we would hear it from where we were.

I started using clear a few years ago and it was amazing! It saved my ass from missing a few flights because the lines for regular pre-check were a mile long and clear was wide open. 

I just flew through 3 different airports on opposite ends of country this month and at each the clear line (even clear with pre-check) was actually longer than the regular pre-check line. At one point it was comical because the clear line had an actual line and the pre-check line had nobody waiting. 

All the people using clear were looking at one another saying, ""when did this happen?"" or ""was it always like this?"". 

The clear staff were getting chewed out and were at one point blaming TSA agents for the wait because the agents reportedly ""did not think clear was fair""...not sure I believe that. 

I don't think it had anything to do with the new ""Next Gen identity"" thing they are doing whatever that is...you have to rescan your eyes / fingers but 2/3 airports didn't even have people re-scanning. Even after getting through the re-scan at one airport, the line for clear was just as long / longer than just regular pre-check anyway so it wasn't the ""skip the line"" experience it used to be. 

I don't plan on renewing my membership. I would not spend $189 on this if I were you. They at one point offered a student membership but they no longer do, so certainly not worth it for a broke student either.

Anybody else feel the same?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1febnfv/post_albania_trip_not_quite_as_friendly_as/,482,"So me and my wife have just come back from a 5 night trip in Albania, Berat and Tirana.  And whilst I didn‚Äôt have super high expectations,  as I know there isn‚Äôt LOADS to do in those cities, everything I had heard about Albania was positive.  Especially the friendliness and how welcoming locals are‚Ä¶

Now reflecting on our trip, we both noted the same thing , how UN friendly so many people were to us. Especially in Berat, it came across as if we was bothering every shop keeper or street food vendor. Ask somebody ‚Äúwhat filling is in this burek‚Äù or ask what price x y item is, and the faces and tone of voice was if we‚Äôd just insulted their mother.

In an antique shop I was flicking through a collection of old banknotes (i collect them) for like 1 and a half minutes, and had the owner angrily come up to me  ‚ÄúARE YOU FINISHED!?!‚Äù. So i Politely asked him how much he was selling them for, and he replies ‚Äú10,20,30 Euros, everyone different! Its collectables not a toy!!‚Äù  When I have literally bought  the same old crappy 1000 italian millie and 10000 turkish lira notes for 3 for ‚Ç¨1 in other places.  The same owner was also rude to another client who asked if he could take a camera out its case.

This was pretty much repeated throughout the trip. And I‚Äôl say now, the locals we stopped and asked for directions etc were overwhelming kind and helpful. But god damn, show owners, food sellers and bus ticket collectors were so miserable and rude.

Now after the trip I went to r/albania to ask a W related to something we noticed in the trip, (the total lack of couples / hand holding or even guys and girls sitting together in restaurants), which me and my wife couldn‚Äôt make sense of. And was bombarded with angry responses of  how I am stuck in a Western European bubble blah blah.

But no, my wife is a Palestinian Gazan, and I am a  European. Muslim revert, so no I can assure everybody I am not coming from this at a ‚Äúwestern bunble‚Äù  perspective.  Infarct have travelled in Jordan, Eastern  Kurdish areas Turkey, Cairo and similar places with zero  issues with rudeness etc.  infact I‚Äôve been to 25 countries, the only place I experienced ruder locals was Belgrade‚Ä¶ 

So the responses unfortunately  seemed to support what we felt on the trip ,  that generally locals seemed to have a very low anger threshold, and the inconvenience of a tourist entering their shop would cause them to be very rude. 

Following me explaining this, one of the commentators commented it was probably our ‚ÄúMuslim ego‚Äù. So without much else evidence, the fact that everybody else seems to have had a great time in Albania with friendly locals being a  top point, maybe it was the fact my wife was Arab that people didn‚Äôt like? 


Did anybody else return from Albania feeling like this?

1. being hassled all the time 
2. being groped 
3. being scammed 

NONE of these happened! Someone explain, what happened to Egypt in the past year that it‚Äôs that much more pleasant.

1. Only hasseling we experienced was at the Giza pyramids but it was just the first 500 m after you enter.
We visited with NO tour guide.
We simply told everyone ‚Äúour tour guide is over there‚Äù and they would leave us alone. Maybe a camel guy followed us for 10/15 m but it was fun in a way.

To be fair, my boyfriend did get harassed by a guy who out of the blue started to feel around my boyfriend ear and was putting my bf‚Äôs hair behind his ear while we were walking. And this happened in Zamalek - what‚Äôs supposed to be a touristy neighbourhood.

3. No one tried to scam us and everything was really, really cheap. 
The only ‚Äútip‚Äù I had to give was to a Pyramids‚Äô security woman who wouldn‚Äôt let me enter with my binoculars. Gave her the equivalent of 0.25 EUR

Day 1: Arrived in Dakar via the direct red eye flight from New York. Chilled around the beach club just below the hotel where we were staying.

Day 2: ‚ÄúReal Dakar‚Äù tour

I‚Äôm not a huge tour person but knew we‚Äôd need one to navigate the Dakar markets, especially due to the language barrier. I found an absolutely fantastic guide, Almamy Badiane. He is mentioned in this NYT article: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/travel/dakar-senegal-52-places-to-go.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare 

Almamy is an excellent guide and extremely chill. It feels more like you‚Äôre exploring Dakar with a friend. These are the spots we hit up.

- grand mosque 
- Fass neighborhood walk plus toured Almamy‚Äôs home
- Medina neighborhood
- Medina market
- Voodoo market
- Mali market
- Arts &amp; crafts market 

Day 3: Goree island

We didn‚Äôt do a tour but just took the ferry and explored. Goree is worth it. It is beautiful &amp; has such a sad history.

Day 4: this was a self guided explore Dakar day. We visited the following sites:
- African Renaissance monument &amp; museum
- Westernmost point of Africa
- Ngor area
- Chilled at La Carre, a seaside lounge bar

During our tour with Almamy he told us about the ‚ÄúLion Dance‚Äù a cultural event in Dakar where a troupe of dancers visits different neighborhoods and puts on local concert and dance. We took Almamy‚Äôs advice and it turned out to be the absolute highlight of our trip. Almamy drove us to a random neighborhood where the troupe was performing that evening and we stayed for hours watching the pre dance rituals and then the show. We were the only two tourists out of hundreds of local neighborhood attendees. The dance &amp; costumes were some of the coolest things I have ever seen.

Day 5: M‚ÄôBour &amp; M‚ÄôBour fish market.

Day 5 we migrated to a beach resort in the town of M‚ÄôBour. This was the relaxation portion of our trip but first we went to M‚ÄôBour fish market. 

The fish market was unlike anything I ever seen. Hundreds and hundreds of sellers and buyers bidding on the days catch. The beach was lined with people shouting their bids to the scores of returning fishermen in their massive pirogues.

Day 6: Bandia Reserve &amp; beach

We went back and forth on seeing the bandia reserve. To be clear this is not a true safari, it is a sanctuary where they have imported animals from South Africa. However some of these animals are indigenous to west Africa but have been hunted to extinction. The reserve was really neat, however you may not enjoy it as much if you‚Äôve been in a true safari.

Day 7: relaxation day: on our final day we just chilled in the beach and at our resort.

Food recs (all in Dakar)
- Le Lagon - very fresh seafood &amp; good views
- La dibiterie le mbote - this is a local skewer spot in a back alley near the markets. It was absolutely incredible food and atmosphere
- Chez Ndioufa - great restaurant for Senegalese staples such as wollof rice or thi√©boudienne.

Might sound silly, but for me the best experience was when we were starving in the Sierras in California. It was summer but it was freezing and raining. We arrived to our campsite, turned our stove on, grabbed some tortilla chips, nacho cheese and jalapenos and decided to make some nachos. Those warm, delicious nachos tasted better than anything I've ever tasted, and I still think about it today.

The gringas (similar to al pastor tacos) in Monterrey, MX in a neighborhood taco stand are a close second. So freaking good",655,2024-07-02 12:41:11,Pale_Field4584,0.91

Mine was seeing a humpback whale chilling under the Golden Gate Bridge when I visited San Francisco for the first time.

I'm looking for recommendations on a realistic budget and method to get there. I've seen all kinds of cruises, but they don't disembark, so they're no-go's. I'm by no means looking for first class, but I don't want to fly spirit and sleep on the floor either, if that makes sense.

I'd be leaving from Southern California, if that changes things. Seems like Ushaia is the best route?

186yxw4,Part 1: Quit my job to travel the world - First year complete - South America,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/186yxw4/part_1_quit_my_job_to_travel_the_world_first_year/,480,"Unfortunately I will need to break this post up into two post as there are too many characters

TLDR at the bottom as this will be a long post.

I (27M) just finished one year (really 11 months and 2 weeks) in South America where I solo traveled to every country except for Venezuela. I will go over the places I went, a full break down of costs for each country, recommendations, and my experiences.

Our demographics and interests can shape our experiences and our views on certain places so here‚Äôs a little bit about me: 27, male, Black-American, 5‚Äô9, I could only speak English when I began and entry level Spanish (A1). I love adventures and taking risk. Love partying and I am Introverted. I enjoy a little chaos.

Well, it all started on Nov 1st 2022 when I quit my job of 5 years. I have a B.S in IT and this was the only job I worked at after graduating from college. I was making $105k when I decided to quit. After working in an office and seeing all of my older colleagues slave away their best years for a house and a car, I decided that‚Äôs not what I wanted and chose to live my life to the fullest now instead of being a corporate slave for the next 40 years. I had been saving since graduating college and I was able to save $50k for a two-year trip. (It was more but I lost a shit ton in crypto).

I decided to do two years because I knew this would most likely be a once in a lifetime opportunity and I wasn‚Äôt going to quit my job just to go for 3-6 months so I decided that I would go as long as I could within what my budget allows and for the destinations I wanted to go to which equated to 2 years.

From Nov ‚Äì Dec I sold all of my belongings, car, motorcycle, paid off all debts, ended my lease, and packed one bag (Osprey 40L), and give any important documents to my brother to hold and I set off to my first destination in early Dec!

My Budget: 24k for South America, 23k for South East Asia, $3k emergency. I also had roughly $3k in credit card points so most of my flights were free including my flights to and from South America. (My budget does not include everything I bought before hand such as my Osprey bag, immunizations, supplies, etc.)

For my two-year journey I decided on South America, South East Asia, and Eastern Europe, this was my first time ever solo traveling and my first time staying in hostels. The longest trip I‚Äôve ever taken was max 2 weeks.

I decided to start in South America as it was closest to the U.S and I wanted to start off learning a language (Spanish), as well I had been to Colombia two months prior so I thought it would be best to start off in a familiar place. I did not plan out my trip, only the first week in Colombia and one week in Rio for Carnaval and the rest I decided to go with the flow.

I used Travel Spend to track all of my spending

&amp;#x200B;

Rating: 8.9/10 (if the food was better the rating would be higher)

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- San Gil - Upon my arrival to the hostel here, within the first 5 minutes I met two guys who weregoing bungee jumping at that moment and told me to come along, I had just taken a 17hour bus ride from Santa Marta and what a better way to wake up than bungee jumping.It was my first time bungee jumping and it was insane! I also did white water rafting,bike across a tight rope between mts. and visited the city.

\- Medellin - Party Party Party, the weather feels like spring all year round - Spent 2 weeks at blinkSpanish school to begin my language learning

\- Minca - Very relaxing place to chill, stayed at Sierra Minca Hostel. I met a guy in Medellin and wewent to Santa Marta together, from there we rented Motor Bikes and rode up to Minca fora few days.

\- Cartagena - Island hopping

\- Cabo de la vela - Arrived here and couldn‚Äôt find my accommodation, had no internet. A nicefamily gave me a room in the back of their restaurant. Practiced my Spanish with themand hung out and played board games. Leaving from Cabo there were no taxis so I had totake a 2 hour ride on a motorbike that was on its last leg through the desert with all of mystuff packed on tight, interesting experience.

Lowlights:

\- Cartagena - Mugged/Robbed in the old town

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: I started off in Medellin one day before my birthday. I was in a 12 bed mixed dorm where I met other solo travelers from Switzerland, Germany, and England and we all formed a group rather quickly. I told them it was my birthday tomorrow so we all decided to go out that night to celebrate, it was an absolute blast and one of the best ways to start my trip. We were all staying at the hostel for a few days so we did a lot of activities together and went out and explored Medellin. After my first week I went over to Blink Spanish Hostel/School where I did 2 weeks of learning before setting off to different cities.

Total accommodation cost: $1806.59 ($20.53/day)

\- Hostels (76 days) ‚Äì $1479.82 ($19.47/day) ‚Äì the price is a bit high because I stayed in hostels for Christmas and New Years and they had shared dinners which drove the price up.

**Brazil:**

Number of days: 85

Places visited: Rio De Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Curitiba, Florianopolis, Balneario Camboriu, Porto Alegre, Macapa, Belem, Recife, Olinda, Salvador, Paraty

Total Cost: $5,632.15 - $66.26/day

Rating: (8.3/10)

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- Rio - Carnaval, dancing and partying at blocos all times of day all over Rio.Enjoyed Copacabana beach

\- Red Hot Chili Peppers Concert

\- Balneario Camboriu - My Airbnb host and his neighbor treated me to an all you can eat buffetand I got to get to know them and the city.

\-Salvador - Beautiful city, I thoroughly enjoyed riding bikes around the beach front

\-Overall - Most cities are very developed, fun hostel scene

Lowlights:

\- I got too comfortable and spent too much time in Airbnbs watching Netflix and didn‚Äôt go out as much as I would have liked. Didn‚Äôt do as many activities as I would have liked though it was good to chill and relax.

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: I went to Brazil from Colombia for Carnaval and it was a wonderful time. I had fun dancing and partying at the blocos. Rio is one of my favorite cities. I started in Rio and rode buses down south until I reached Porto Alegre. I highly recommend Curitiba and Balneario Camboriu, a lot of people like Florianopolis but I think those two places are better down south. They are pretty big on buffets and you should go to eat at one at least once. When I came back around from the French Guiana I rode buses from the north down until I reached Rio again so I‚Äôve basically seen the entire coast of Brazil. Brazil is very developed and is where I spent the most time relaxing in Airbnbs.

**Uruguay:**

Number of days: 12

Places visited: Montevideo, Punta Del Este, Sacramento de Colonia

Total Cost: $598.01- $49.83/day

Rating: 7/10

Highlights:

\- Sacramento is a cool colonial town and I rode the boat from here to Buenos Aires

\- Experiencing one of the largest outdoor markets

Lowlights:

\- Went to Punta Del Este during the wrong time, was too cold so not much was open.

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: I flew from Brazil to Montevideo to one of the smallest capital city airports I‚Äôve seen. The people at the airport told me it would cost $80 for a taxi from the airport to the city so instead I followed the locals to a city bus which only costs $5. Montevideo is very quiet and safe, one of the safest places I felt walking around at night. They have a large outdoor market on Sundays. I rode the bus up to Punta Del Este but since winter was coming around everything was mostly closed. I rode the bus down to Sacramento which is a nice old colonial town. From there I took a boat over to Buenos Aires. If you want to visit Uruguay but you don‚Äôt have much time, you should go to Buenos Aires and take a day drop to Sacramento by boat, well worth it. Not much going on in Uruguay.

Total accommodation cost: $206.12 ($17.17/ day)

\- Hostels (12 days) ‚Äì $206.12

Number of days: 50

Places visited: Buenos Aires, Tigre, Rosario, Cordoba, Iguazu Falls, Salta, San Salvador de Jujuy, Tilcara, Humahuaca, Mendoza

Total Cost: $2536.87- $50.74/day

Rating: 8.6/10 (but Buenos Aires gets a 9/10)

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- Buenos Aires is absolutely beautiful and huge, it‚Äôs a place I could live in long term. Stayed here for 3 weeks.

\- Cool to experience Iguazu Falls

\- Very cool to see the pueblitos in the desert such as Tilcara

\- Best 5 course steak dinner I‚Äôve ever had

\- Very cheap, get the blue dollar rate while it lasts

Lowlights:

\- I had a negative experience with a Chinese shop owner in Buenos Aires

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: Another one of my favorite countries, unfortunately I did not get to see the south of Argentina as it was too cold so I will be coming back. Very cheap country at the moment due to the blue dollar rate. Great place for top tier steak and wine in Mendoza. Buenos Aires is an absolutely beautiful city and very big, you can ride around on bikes all over the city. It has a European style influence. Be sure to check out Iguazu Falls and go over to the Brazilian side to see both views. I did the boat ride under the falls on the Argentinian side where they take you right up to the falls and you get drenched, it was epic! Salta is a cool town up north and you must go to the pueblos out in the desert if you do go to Salta. A lot of people told me Argentina is a racist country but I did not experience any from Argentinians when I was there. Highly recommend!

**Chile:**

Number of days: 15

Places visited: Santiago, Valparaiso, San Pedro De Atacama

Total Cost: $1103.16- $78.80/day

Rating: (6.6/10) ‚Äì Cloudy and cold, no me gusta.

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- San Pedro De Atacama: - Fun desert experience, rode a bike out of the town through the desertwith lots of cool places to see

Lowlights:

\- Santiago: - Felt a bit dangerous, was cloudy, rainy and cold most of the time. Expensive

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: I arrived to Santiago by bus from Mendoza, Argentina. It was cool riding through the snowcapped mountains. When we arrived to the city there was a bit of a SMOG. It was cold, rainy, and cloudy. The city isn‚Äôt bad but its almost just like every other capital city in South America. Good walking tours you can do but it is a bit dangerous. I heard of many people being robbed as well as a tourist being shot and robbed. Do not have your phones out when walking down the street. I did not get to go to the South of Chile as again it was too cold, so I will have to come back. Valparaiso is an interesting spot. The best place I went to was out in the desert to San Perdo de Atacama. It‚Äôs a nice little pueblo and here you can do the Uyuni tour and also check out cool sights outside of the desert. Would recommend when its not cold.

Total accommodation cost: $425.18 ($28.35/ day)

\- Hostels (8 days) ‚Äì $139.88

**Paraguay:**

Number of days: 7

Places visited: Ciudad Del Este, Asuncion

Total Cost: $336.37- $48.05/day

Rating: (7.8/10)

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- Ciudad Del Este

\- Crossed over from Brazil in a bus, didn‚Äôt stop at immigration, stayed in the country illegally.

\- Asuncion

\- I didn‚Äôt see any tourist here. The locals were very nice, people were excited to see me andwaving at me and giving me peace signs as I was walking down the street. Very calm place,developed city but not much to do.

Lowlights:

\- Ciudad Del Este

\- This city has a very high Chinese population and even a China town. When I was walking through some Chinese kids saw me coming and RAN inside and stared at me with fear from the window.

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: I crossed over from Brazil to Ciudad Del Este by bus. They do not stop at the border checkpoint/immigration so I entered the country illegally. In Ciudad Del Este its basically a huge shopping market for Brazilians and Argentineans to buy cheap products, thousands cross the border every day and its basically an ‚Äúopen border‚Äù. In this border town they have security guards walking around with shotguns everywhere so it may be a little dangerous but I didn‚Äôt really feel any danger when I was there. I took a bus from here to Asuncion where I stayed a week. They don‚Äôt really get much tourism so I stuck out like a sore thumb. Not much going on in this country, just people living.

Total accommodation cost: $159 ($22.71/ day)

\- Hotels (3 days) ‚Äì $40.32

\- Airbnb (4 Days - Asuncion) - $118.68

1dwq5ku,Left 2 laptops in TSA bin at Orlando Airport,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dwq5ku/left_2_laptops_in_tsa_bin_at_orlando_airport/,474,"I thought this would never happen to me. Am traveling with family from MCO(Orlando) To LGW(London Gatwick). At the TSA checkpoint? I took out 2 laptops, one was mine and the other was my son‚Äôs, and put it in the tray. On the other side of the scanner, I got distracted because my belt had gotten stuck in the conveyor belt. In all the confusion I forgot to take the 2 laptops which were in the same bin. After landing in Gatwick is when I realized that the laptops were missing. I did not put any labels on the laptop.

I submitted a lost and found online form for Orlando airport. I will check the lost and found section at Orlando once I am back in 2 weeks.

Does anyone have experience with laptop recovery at Orlando airport. I am really anxious and hope I get it back.

EDIT: Thank you very much everyone for all your helpful responses.

I was able to get my laptops back from Orlando Airport lost and found on my return journey. The whole process was smooth and easy. The team is very prompt and responded quickly to emails. TSA had submitted the laptops to lost and found dept on the same day that I left them, and subsequently, lost and found immediately responded to my email with the bin number where the laptops were stored.

A few best practices I leant through this experience and from comments of everyone here:

1. Put labels on your laptops/tablets/phones including your name, address and phone number.  

2. When you remove things such as belts, laptops, keys, etc, make sure to place your carryon bag in the last bin, behind at all your other items. That way, you will get your removed items first on the other side and not miss them as you wait for your carryon bag.

3.  Do not be in a hurry to rush through TSA. It is a chaotic, noisy environment where TSA agents behave like they are herding cattle, shouting and verbally pushing folks to keep moving to keep the lines short. This creates lot of pressure to rush because we don‚Äôt want to be shouted at and look like an idiot. Keep your head calm and go at your own pace while keeping the focus on your items.

4. Do not go to the screening magnetometer until you have ensured your last item has entered the scanner on the conveyor belt. Sometimes I have seen that folks who were behind me put their trays before my trays/bags, which caused my trays to come later than I would have expected.

5. If traveling with family, ensure everyone, including kids, are designated one item that they will be responsible for throughout the journey. 

6. Don‚Äôt get overconfident. Be alert and focused when going through TSA or airlines. You may have travelled a lot and did not forgot anything up to now. It doesn‚Äôt mean you will not leave something behind in future.

7. Don‚Äôt put anything in the seat pockets in planes. This could result in forgetting something there at some point. Plus those pockets are never cleaned well anyway.

8. Get TSA Pre Check, you will not be required to remove electronics/laptops from bags and TSA folks are more courteous and less hurried in that section. It‚Äôs only $78 for 5 years.",97,2024-07-06 08:54:38,mikefl2011,0.9

1gfqhvk,I'm having a dispute with Iceland Air. They say I no-showed. I have security footage that proves that I didn't. What next?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gfqhvk/im_having_a_dispute_with_iceland_air_they_say_i/,469,"Edit: muting reply notifications. Getting told that this is my fault at 10th time isn't going to help. 

Edit: here is the proof that Iceland Air knew about the PDX to SEA flight, this is an email from them [one](https://i.imgur.com/mAgAZvT.png) [two](https://i.imgur.com/fRrEmcg.png) -- we were at PDX at 1415 on the day day we were supposed to leave. 

This is a long story, I'm going to try to make it short. 

We showed up to our flight 2 and 1/2 hours early because my travel partner is extremely anxious about traveling so they wanted to get there as early as humanly possible. We got there and tried to check in with Iceland Air. We were told that the plane was delayed and we wouldn't be able to check in at all for about 3 and 1/2 hours. So we hung out at the airport for a while. I got a little suspicious because the plane was never showing up on the board. At this point the Iceland air counter was closed. So I went looking in the Iceland Air app and it turns out that we had a connecting flight that was operated by Alaska. My best guess is that the Iceland air counter agent was looking at the wrong airport, The flight from Seattle to Reykjavik and on to Amsterdam was delayed. But the flight from Portland to Seattle was not delayed.

When I went to the Alaska kiosk they told me that the flight had already left. 

So because of this Iceland air says that I never showed up and they wanted to charge me $2,000 to move my flight to the next day. Because they said they couldn't even guarantee that I could get out on the flight the next day (this is according to the counter agent) I ended up buying outbound tickets on British Air. $1200 each, 2 tickets and one lost day of travel. The cost of my vacation just went up by $2400.

Fast forward to about a month later, I'm trying to get some sort of satisfaction out of this. I paid the airport so that I could get the security footage of me standing at the counter with my travel partner. I tried to resolve this with my credit card, they couldn't do anything about it. I tried to resolve this with Iceland Air, they told me that they would need to talk to a supervisor etc. so I sent them a very detailed itinerary of who I talked to and dates and times and the security footage email along with screenshots from the security footage with arrows pointing to me and my travel partner. Today they told me that ""too bad, so sad, nothing we can do"" essentially. They aren't even offering to give me a voucher. 

I want to reiterate: I have **literal security footage** of me talking to somebody at the Iceland air counter 2 and 1/2 hours before my plane was supposed to leave. Apparently this is not good enough for Iceland Air. 

I'm at about 4 hours on the phone to try to get this resolved already. I'm pretty done with these fuckers. The customer service has been terrible. 

I know I can talk to the Iceland Travel authority. Maybe that's the next thing to do. But I don't anticipate a lot of satisfaction out of that. I don't know if small claims or arbitration is an option here. But the preponderance of evidence is on my side, I'm comfortable pursuing legal action on this.",242,2024-10-30 11:20:06,ryhaltswhiskey,0.73
1e4v8gw,"Unpopular (?) Opinion: There is no ""best"" airline",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e4v8gw/unpopular_opinion_there_is_no_best_airline/,467,"Assuming you're comparing apples to apples (ie, full-service carrier to full-service carrier, LCC to LCC), then there's just not a lot of differentiation between carriers flying the same/similar route. *Especially* in economy class. Economy seats are essentially identical across all airlines and aircraft types. The legroom is essentially identical. The meals are all equally crappy. The lavatories are all equally cramped and uncomfortable. They're all equally susceptible to severe weather, random mechanical failures, etc. They all have employees who offer good, mediocre and poor customer service, and its a crapshoot as to which of those you'll experience. If severe weather strikes your airport and suddenly 1000s of people have had their travel disrupted, they're all equally awful in trying to deal with that.

The experience in you have in seat 38K on a United 787 is not going to be materially distinguishable from seat 35F on a KLM A330. Your Delta flight from Chicago to Phoenix is going to look pretty much the same as an American flight on that same route. When you're buying an economy ticket, its just not worth paying attention to that one person who claimed they got a slightly less crappy reheated meal on Turkish Airlines versus that other person who claimed they had an extra centimeter of legroom on Swiss.

There's *maybe* a little more product differentiation in premium cabins, where airlines do tend to offer differences in seat types, meals and other perks. And by all means, if you're flying in a premium cabin, pay attention to product reviews and find the product that looks most attractive for what you value most. There's a whole industry of travel bloggers and vloggers who make their livings chronicling their thoughts on the quality of the mixed nuts and cheese platters that they get served in business class.

But for economy class, there's not some secret formula to find the ""best"" way to fly between Chicago and Frankfurt, or New York and Paris. Plug your departure and arrival cities, and travel dates, into a search engine like Kayak or Google Flights. Play around with alternate dates or nearby cities to whatever extent you want. If you're trying to build your points/miles balance on a particular alliance's loyalty program, see if that makes those flights more attractive than a competitors. Find the offering with the schedule and price that's the best fit for your needs. Then book the ticket directly through the airline. Whether you end up on Qatar or Emirates or Lufthansa, it won't really matter.

(The *only* ""hack"" I'd suggest accounting for when traveling internationally is whether one airline offers additional consumer protection. Note that this is purely a function of *the country where the airline is registered*, and has *nothing* to do with anecdotal reports of good or poor customer service. For example, flying an EU-flagged carrier from the US to Europe offers increased consumer protection (via EU/261) versus flying a US-flagged carrier on the same route. If this is relevant to your itinerary, it may effect your choice of airline.)",329,2024-07-16 12:56:48,Mindless-Tomorrow-93,0.81

1. Booked fare with the full refund if cancelled within 24hrs
2. Booked the flight as it was a good price and had to organise a connecting flight to get there. 
3. Connecting flight was working out too expensive so went to cancel the Qatar airways flight with full refund.
4. Qatar airways charged me $900 to cancel within 24hrs.

Why? Because even though I cancelled within 24hrs of paying for my booking - they said that I initiated the search for the booking 24 hrs and 40mins before cancelling.

So beware of Qatar airways sneaky and devious tactics. Argued with them that their own terms and conditions clearly state ""full refund if cancelled within 24hrs of booking"" and that searching is not booking. 

They didn't care, they wouldn't back down and said any refund would cost me $900. Repeatedly told me the booking is made from the minute you search for flights.

And yes I know I should have simply put the Booking on hold. ",91,2024-09-21 00:41:28,NoReflection3822,0.95

Absolutely no sane person would get mad for not receiving a tip. Tips in Europe are truly optional and actually, when someone tips, he usually rounds up the bill. No person would sit and calculate percentages. They just round up the bill if they choose to, but not doing so isn't going to cause any problems.

1gnn285,I visited the 9/11 Memorial and Museum today. ‚ÄúHarrowing‚Äù is the closest word I can think of to describe the experience ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gnn285/i_visited_the_911_memorial_and_museum_today/,447,"I am a 1995 baby and thus don‚Äôt really remember anything about 9/11. I vaguely remember just being in class at school, but that‚Äôs it. But, as I grew older, I of course read and learned more and more about it. And on my current trip to NYC, I decided to visit the World Trade Center plaza, the pools and lastly the museum. 

For the first two items, I had a tour guide take me and a group through a short history lesson on the construction of the towers, the events of 9/11 itself and the construction of One World Trade Center. After my tour was up, I went to the museum. 

I don‚Äôt know what I expected, honestly. I had no idea what I would be walking into. And‚Ä¶yeah. It‚Äôs a lot. By a lot, I don‚Äôt just mean the tons of artifacts such as wrecked fire trucks, destroyed ambulances, pieces of the tower, seeing images of people jumping from the windows, personal items from the victims, etc. No, I also mean the weight of being there, hearing these stories, reliving the events hour by hour‚Ä¶it weighed heavily on me. You‚Äôre literally standing where so many people cried out for help that never found them until it was too late. I was exhausted by the time I left, and I nearly cried afterwards. What really did me in a little tiny bit was hearing Taps being played as I went back up the steep escalator, thinking about the wall of victims. 

If anything, amongst all the turmoil I had witness today, it gave me a much deeper respect for first responders, particularly the firemen. 343. That‚Äôs how many FDNY firefighters died that day. Each of them knowing they probably weren‚Äôt coming back down the towers, but going anyway. There aren‚Äôt enough words to describe how amazing they were. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm glad I went. I really am. But it was a lot to deal with, and it hurt me up inside a bit. ",127,2024-11-09 17:31:39,Matilda_Mother_67,0.88

Anyone else got any hostel horror stories? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1axx7tz/first_night_of_a_8_month_trip_drunk_guy_pisses/,452,"loool the title says it all. We had been travelling for 30+ hours to finally arrive at our hostel. 

On arriving,  we are informed they had tripled the price of our beds in a dorm because of a recent change in price structure (even though we had booked this months ago). We had not slept more than 50 mins for the whole journey so by that point we were so knackered we just accepted the loss. We were given the option of a refund if we found some alternative accommodation in the next few days. We agreed to just have a shop around online once we got some kind of sleep as our brains were completely fried. 

I managed to get some sleep but my partner has never stayed in hostels before so he was up the whole night (from a mixture of jet lag and general noise in and outside the hostel). Anyway, I woke up to the sound of what I thought was rain. Then I thought hang on, this sounds like someone pissing but why is it so loud? I pulled the curtain that was across my bottom bunk open to see some drunk guy pissing ALL over the floor right by my head and our bags were sat in his piss. Fair to say I gave him a bollocking, he said it wasn‚Äôt his fault because he was really drunk, wiped around the floor abit with his towel then got in his bunk and went back to sleep. 

Hostel staff were apologetic and agreed to give us a refund, we luckily found a cheap private room and I washed our stuff. I promised my partner that they‚Äôre not all like this hahaha I feel awful he had such a weird first experience lol

Anyone else had any hostel horror stories?

1dzu3in,"""Japan-like"" travel destinations ?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dzu3in/japanlike_travel_destinations/,451,"I know the title is a little strange and Japan is too unique to find another travel destination similar to it.

2.  **Easy to get around using public transport** 
3.  **Relatively safe.**

18lvddo,Air Asia is SHIT,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18lvddo/air_asia_is_shit/,455,"Recently flew from Sydney to Taipei with layover in Kuala Lumpur. Got to the airport 3 hours beforehand and the queue to check in and drop baggage was so fucking long, even though I was middle of the pack (another half was even later than me), I barely made it to the gates by scheduled boarding time with no time to go to TRS.

After we boarded the plane at 9pm (flight scheduled at 9:40pm), a little bit of rain started falling so they made us wait an hour while seated on the cramped shitty plane THEN an hour after, they broadcasted that we had to wait ANOTHER hour. By now (11:20pm) everyone was already tired and restless when they reported that they had to CANCEL the flight and we all had to leave the plane, collect our luggage and go wait in a queue to await compensation. 

While we waited at the queue of 200-300 people at 12:30am, with only 2 service desks open, they nonchalantly went through a customer at a time. There were others, like me, who had connecting flights, while probably only 60% of the passengers were disembarking at KL. After waiting in line for an hour (1:30am) word got passed down the queue that they were putting us on a flight at 7pm, delaying our schedule by 22hours and not giving any food voucher or cash compensation. 

Another 30mins later, one of the staff confirmed that there were NO earlier flights and that if we wanted, we could leave and refund the ticket but at peak season, there was no guarantee we could even book another flight and no way it would be financially worth it. They also told us, because there was some event going on, they couldn't find us any hotels, so we could find our OWN accommodation and that they would cover the fee and the taxi fare to get there but it was the dead of night and no fucking hotels were free (I called 20-30 hotels with expectedly no prevail). They explicitly told us the compensation for taxis and shit would be easy, that all we had to do is bring our receipts in tomorrow at the service desk and they would refund us on the spot. By this point, a lot of people had left but I thought to stay and ask about my connecting flight. Another hour later, I asked if there were any ways of getting an earlier flight or an alternative flight route to get there earlier as I had pre-purchased train tickets in Taipei already, but they very bluntly said no. It wasn't until the morning after that I realised this was a lie and that there were seats on an earlier flight that they decided not to disclose to us. 

I took a taxi to my mates who let me crash that night and a taxi back the day after. I arrived at check in an hour early (there were already 20 or so people lined up at the counter according to those big flight info screens) and 5minutes before check in started, they decided to relocate us to the other side so everyone basically lost their spot in the queue. Slowly, they checked us in and it looked like everyone was dissatisfied after checking in. It wasn't until I got to the check in counter and handed them my receipts that I realised why. These fuckers told us they weren't able to compensate us on the spot and that we had to go through the app and this entire process to get the money back for the taxi fares and shit.

It's been a little over two weeks of meticulously replying to their shit customer support, their long emails that are purposely trying to confuse customers and discourage them from finishing the process, short deadlines, and I have still yet to receive the compensation. Even for a cheap shitty budget airline, this has got to be a fucking joke.

1f75ubm,Weekday trip to Turkey (Istanbul): observations,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f75ubm,450,"It was my first time in Istanbul and I just wanna share my observations

1. Main attractions
We have visited Dolmabah√ße palace, Hagia Sofia, Basilic Cistern, Topkapi palace, Galata tower and Blue mosque (the only one for free). Overall cost was 5460 Lyra per 1, or 145 euros.
Topkapi was the most expensive, though maybe worth it. But after visiting Hagia Sofia and Galata tower you feel deceived.
As for Hagia Sophia it costs 25 euros. For this price you can visit just gallery, not the whole mosque or Hagia Sofia museum. Museum is for additional fee (which is also 25 euros) and the craziest that first floor of mosque is available ONLY FOR TURKISH CITIZENS and we couldn‚Äôt get in there.
Fun fact is that official muze.gov.tr mentions that Hagia Sofia is NOT THE MUSEUM and you can‚Äôt use your museum card to visit it.
So, you should pay just to see the gallery floor, while Turkish citizens have right to go in first floor of mosque for free
Galata tower is impressing, but just for it view on the city. For this view and 30-minute walk they charged 30 euros. The working hours is 8:30-22:00. And I recommend to visit it at 8:30-9:00 am because it is time without queues :)
Dolmabah√ße palace seemed beautiful, but very extremely - just sofas, chairs, golds and beds :/
Topkapi palace is another matter. Besides harem and just rooms, there is holy relics, sultan‚Äôa library, kitchens, royal treasure, weapons and many other things

2. Public transportation
We have bought Istanbul city card for 3 days for 800 Lyra. It totally didn‚Äôt worse it, though you can use it for any public transport (including ferry). Transport network contains a lot of lines, but for the city centre they are short and you should do a transfer. Every transfer counts like a new trip and charged as well.
Often it was just faster to walk, than to use buses or underground for city center :/

3. European and Asian parts
The first day we spent at European side and it was very crowded, loud and smells like deception. The other day we go to Asian part. It was crowded too, but it was so authentic, food was better and cheaper, coffee was tastier. Moda district reminds me the best part of Moscow - just cafes, sea, sunset and relax was in the air. 100% place to visit

4. Trip duration
As for weekend trip, I think Istanbul is good option for sightseeing. But if you want to shop, go to prince islands and visit more just regular attractions, it is better to plan 5-day trip in Istanbul

Conclusions
The main attractions are expensive, food is tasty and cheap, cats are soft and like eating

The fees are increasing to help raise more funds for conservation,  infrastructure and the community, according to the Galapagos  Conservation Trust (GCT).",74,2024-04-09 16:40:40,guyoffthegrid,0.97

I said no, and thought it was weird. The airline we were flying has a strict luggage policy and they made me check my carry-on before going through security (I wasn't allowed a carry-on), so I wondered why they let her go through with too many bags. 
When we started queuing to board, I saw several other people, apparently all from the same group, asking other passengers to take their luggage. I noticed one of them had a duty free bag full with several bottle of the same perfume. 

What were they doing? Have you ever seen this?

17zmwgv,"4 days on the island of Newfoundland, Canada, in October",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17zmwgv,436,"We spent 4 days hiking Western part of Newfoundland, around Gros Morne National Park, and we were absolutely mindblown. We were based out of a little B&amp;B in Deer Lake that has its own airport, to avoid flying into Saint John's on the opposite of the island.

1. View from the Lookout trail, a must do to get a view of the whole area and the said Gros Morne mountain

2. Driving around Newfoundland, it is a destination that is definitely best explored with a car (I say this as someone who always prefers busing around)

3-4. Cedar Cove trail

5. Another view from the Lookout trail, we actually missed a black bear near that area that other hikers saw just 5 minutes before.

6. Tablelands trail, the whole area is very geologically unique because the plate tectonics have brought to the surface the mantle of the earth

7. The fog and the rain actually gave the landscape even more charm, we didn't mind it, and overall Newfoundland reminded me a lot of Norway ! 

8-9. James Cook Heritage Trail / Tortoise Mountain, I took many more pictures but my lense got covered in rain

10-12. Coastal Trail, a 2h flat and lovely walk

11. The coastal trail lead you to a big tent of beautiful Tuckamore trees, they're very unique and it feels magic

13. Just a pretty forest, I really enjoyed how vibrant nature is on the island

14. View from the top of the Berry Hill Trail, it's a steep but short ascent

15. Sunset at the Lobster Cove Head

16-17. Western Brook Trail, you can take a boat tour to get within the fjord but sadly we were one week after the end of peak season and the period of operation

18. Green Garden trail",51,2023-11-20 05:56:29,smolbibeans,0.98

1ciowmx,"Is this a new scam? ""I have a similar bag""",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ciowmx/is_this_a_new_scam_i_have_a_similar_bag/,424,"Hello everyone, I'm writing in about an odd experience I had landing at Fort Lauderdale Airport yesterday. Not many Reddit posts talk about this, so I wonder if anyone can relate. BF and I had just landed from a quick vacay. We grabbed our suitcase, which was pink and hard shelled. Also notable is that I totally matched with it--pink jacket, pink purse, pink suitcase. So I think it was obvious that I own it.

It also had a very distinctive fabric tied to the handle, and our luggage lock was still in the same position we left it before taking off. It was one of the first (**edit**: not **the** first bag, just early) suitcases off the conveyer, so we were quick and easily grabbed it and headed out for our ride, who was close and outside.

As we're booking it to find our ride outside, a man suddenly appeared from either sitting on one of the benches or from wherever and says something like ""hey, I have a similar bag to yours! Can I check to see if that's not mine?"" And he kinda had a playful smile on his face, which implied unserious scam to me.

I was already super pissed from an unpleasant experience getting off the plane, so I was \****really***\* not in the mood for bs or to be scammed or taken advantage of any further, so I went ""no, absolutely not. this is definitely our bag!"" But the man wouldn't let up. He repeated himself more forcefully, basically repeating ""I have a similar bag!!"" Like insisting he check our bag. When my bf firmly spoke up and I really raised my voice that it's our bag, he stopped following us.

I thought this was so odd and annoying, because if he truly had lost a similar looking bag:

* Wouldn't he be *inside* trying to find it? Or speaking to security/ lost luggage?
* We had *just* gotten there, so if someone stole his bag, wouldn't they have been long gone by now?
* Let's say he actually came from *our* flight-- it was too soon to say that all bags hadn't come off the conveyer, so why instantly run to someone and want to check their bag?
* He had no idea what carousel we came from and there are so many flights, so why is our pink suitcase likely his?
* If he owned a similar bag, shouldn't he already have it and want to switch it with ours? Why should we give him our bag for nothing?
* Would he likely own a pink suitcase anyway? (**edit**: I totally know men can love pink! I didn't say 0% chance.)
* He had no right to inspect my definite suitcase!

Ultimately, my theory was that he was in a pickpocketing team, trying to plant something in the bag, or trying to accuse and scare us into giving him free luggage and things...? I have no clue!



**Edit:** Thank you for your stories and perspectives so far! I want to clarify-- we had already walked outside and *well away* from the original carousel. I felt he stood up from an outside bench out of the corner of my eye, but I understand I don't know exactly where he came from. All I know is I had bad vibes because we were \*well\* away from the original carousel and already walked outside, so I appreciate everyone who can see it from my perspective. 

Like I said, I've only seen posts from the perspective of people who legit had their bag taken--never from the perspective of literally having their rightful bag. Again, it's odd because I don't believe he was on my flight and it was so far from the origin point. I made the choice that I felt would keep us safest in that moment considering what was going on, and I don't regret it. I assertively told the guy it was our bag, so it was his responsibility to go inside and find his (I'd personally be inside frantically looking at the carousel if I lost mine) 

Hope this story helps someone make their own best choice in the future, whether that's to stop and let someone into their personal space or not.",304,2024-05-02 14:47:31,HZBandersnatch,0.81

1e35gvp,Picturesque Sardinia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1e35gvp,424,"
My first post here about one of my favorite places, visited during July.

My itinerary included the beautiful towns of Cagliari, Bosa, and Alghero.

Cagliari: We stayed in Cagliari, which offers a mix of historic charm and modern amenities, with various restaurants and bars. The combination of the old city center and the new one gives a unique perspective of the town, making it perfect for scenic walks. Just an hour's drive away, you‚Äôll find some of the island's best beaches, like Su Giudeu and Tuerredda (though they can get crowded). Most beaches in Sardinia have designated areas with beach chairs, while the rest is free to use. Note that parking is paid, and having a car is essential to fully explore this beautiful island.

Bosa: Bosa, a small village on the northwest side of the island, is undoubtedly worth visiting. It‚Äôs the most picturesque place in Sardinia, with a river running through the town and many colorful houses creating a stunning view. The castle atop the hill provides a great view of the town and surrounding landscape. We combined our visit to Bosa with a trip to Is Arutas beach. Near this beach, we found a hidden gem: Ros‚Äôe Mari Farm &amp; Greenhouse restaurant. Located in the middle of nowhere, this relaxing spot offers a unique culinary experience and is undoubtedly at the top of my list.

Alghero: Alghero is a town you shouldn‚Äôt miss. It felt like stepping back into the medieval era. This castle-town boasts spectacular architecture and beautiful walking paths inside its walls. Be sure to try the pizza at Caj√≤ and follow it with gelato from ReGelato. There are plenty of beaches in Alghero to complete your day trip.

All in all Sardinia proved a unique experience. Great choice to spent some of my vacation.",19,2024-07-14 10:47:15,apostolog,0.98

1ca2zo4,Vent- choose your travel companions wisely.  A terrible group can ruin an otherwise perfect trip!,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ca2zo4/vent_choose_your_travel_companions_wisely_a/,422,"Omg, I just returned from an alleged dream trip to South East Asia.  Everything we planned went perfectly.  Our companions ruined an otherwise ""perfect"" get away.  

I love South East Asia.  Everything about it just makes me happy.  It's a long flight from my home base of the US, but there is no placed I've been that I haven't adored.  (OK, there are a few over touristed sites but still...)

So my family heard that I had an upcoming trip and everyone convinced me that it would be a great idea if they ALL joined.  My small intimate trip ballooned into a circus with 12 people from multiple US states and two continents.  I didn't mind, they would never visit on their own and would be intimidated if they hadn't come with me.  

My husband and I agreed to take care of all the planning from itinerary to hotels,  tours, flights and even visa applications.  I even changed my original itinerary (planned for me and hubs) to expand it so that we would hit some of my favorite places.  Everything went off without a hitch.  The hotels were beautiful, the flights were on time, and the pacing was perfect. 

Despite this, it was the absolute worse trip of my life completely ruined by my companions.  People were complaining it was too hot in countries known for their tropical climates.  They complained about the traffic.  The night markets were too loud.  They forgot to tell their banks they were travelling and couldn't withdraw money which was somehow everyone's fault but there own.  I even offered to give them my money (and they could pay me back), but not good enough.  Service was too slow, or they were rude to the staff. Even though I assured them they could eat the street food, no we needed to go to the resort.  Even though it was hot, they refused grabs and rickshaws for short walks and then made exaggerated complaints about the weather.    Some members of the group were absolute troopers, but it was offset by the remainder of complete tools.  The only person who got food poisoning only ate at the resorts and hotels. *Que evil laugh.*

I was so, SO frustrated.  Eventually, I got tired if babysitting, told everyone what I was doing by whatsapp  and escaped.  After that, they mostly stayed in the resorts/hotels and I went out exploring with my hubs and the noncrazies.  NEVER AGAIN will I travel with these people.  NEVER.  Do not be me.  Choose your companions wisely. 

(And I had traveled with this group before when I got married in India to my husband.  They were much more obedient pre-covid.  However, several on that trip  ignored our explicit warnings NOT to eat street food and got sick right before my wedding.) ",95,2024-04-22 00:39:06,cutiebird31,0.94
1emscqg,I went to Southern Africa for two and a half weeks (Trip Report),https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1emscqg,418,"Recently returned from a two and a half week trip in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and very briefly South Africa with my family. It combined safari, relaxation, adventure, and slow travel luxury. 

We started by flying into Maun from Johannesburg and then hopped on a few helicopters to go into the Okavango Delta. July is the dry season and having a look from above really showed where the water could be in the wet season. There were some areas that were especially black, almost like lightning had hit, that were actually dried up watering holes. Pretty soon after taking off the elephants started to appear down around the river. There were a few zebras and ostriches also wandering around. 

Our first three nights were in a mobile camp. Still glamping with big tents, but with bucket showers and dug out holes for toilets. The sites change with each set of guests. For us the site was right on the main channel of a river (I don‚Äôt believe the main river) with hundreds of animals grazing in the distance. We did one game drive towards sunset and saw plenty of elephants, antelopes, zebras, and a couple hippos waking up from their daytime naps. The two full days we spent in the Xaxaba area were very similar to each other. We took mokoros, which are basically the bush version of canoes, along the main channel to the big island (Chief‚Äôs Island) for a walking safari/nature walk along with our three guides. This was one of my favorite parts of the trip. We had been to Tanzania on safari before, which was phenomenal and a big inspiration for wanting to do this trip, but that was only ever game drives and often with a lot of other cars when there was a notable animal sighting. Walking through the bush, getting to see animal tracks in the sand, and animals from the ground was a really special feeling. On the second day we spotted a pride of lions from 400 or so yards away. Unfortunately, or fortunately according to my mom, they left pretty quickly and we never saw them any closer. The island had tons of elephants, buffalo, antelope, and the odd giraffe. In the evenings we had mokoro rides along the channel. Think of a gondola ride in Venice but in the middle of nowhere with nobody else around. This was not so big on game sighting, but really peaceful and relaxing. We did see a few eagles in a tree and other birds from the water level, as well as hearing the hippos waking up as the sun went down. I really recommend a mobile safari. It is a big rugged and not for everybody but being able to sit out and watch elephants walking by while eating lunch is a great experience.

Next we took a half hour bush flight to Khwai, a private concession just on the outside of the Okavango Delta. Private concessions are what they sound like, privately owned by the local communities and not under the control of the government. This probably means the game is not as abundant with the government wanting the best land, but I feel it is important to support local communities (it is also cheaper and staying in the Delta proper is mega expensive in the high season). Khwai was the low point of our trip. This was largely due to our lodge (African Excursions Guesthouse) staff being, seemingly, completely uninterested in us, despite being the only five people there at the time. Three activities per day turned into two after they told us they were worried about us being too tired, but it was clearly a them problem. We also frankly just did not get very lucky on our game drives. The high point for me was stumbling on a hyena den near sunset with a mom and her pups hanging out. Two of the babies were very curious about our vechicle and walked right up to it and even underneath. Very adorable for such a ferocious animal. We also saw some gigantic herds off buffalo, more elephants maybe fifteen feet away, plenty of very colorful birds including my new favorite lilac breasted roller, and one serval at the end of our night game drive. Night drive is something I think that is better in theory than in reality. If you can spot a big cat in a tree and get a light on it, I imagine that would be really amazing, but that seems pretty unlikely.

Stop three in Botswana was Chobe National Park and the abosolute greatest day and a half of safari. It simply had everything. We were rushed from the airport to our lodge to have enough time to get in an afternoon drive. Our guide asked us where we came from and his first question when he heard Khwai was if we had seen any cats. Unsurprised that we hadn‚Äôt (no offense to the serval) he made it his mission to find some before sunset. Much busier than Khwai or Xaxaba, but still nowhere near Serengeti level busy, another group alerted everyone to two lions atop a hill and we got to see them sleep, wake up, get in the mood, and put on a quick show for everyone. With them relaxed we got to drive up and get about forty feet away. Then we heard there was a leopard sighting not far away and rushed over. It was tucked away behind some trees with a narrow path where our vehicle had to wait and all seven of us had to wait to go in and back out in single file. When it was our turn and we got behind the tree we didn‚Äôt see anything, at first all looking up at branches expecting the leopard to be hanging out. Then we saw it on the ground in a little ravine, no more than thirty feet away, staring right back at us. It seemed like it was relaxing after having just secured dinner with big antelope just nearby. We wanted cats and we got them. The next day was the best day of the trip. We got extremely close to giraffes for the first time this trip, saw kudus, rare roan and sable antelopes, saw a beautiful bee eater bird, all while seeing almost no other tourists with baobab trees in red dirt with views out over the Chobe River into Namibia. Then, already so much more than content, on our way back to lunch our guide spotted a cheetah just lougning on the side of the road. He drove by it initially but then backed up, where the cheetah got a bit shy and got up and walked back behind the tree line, but stayed put long enough to get a few nice shots. Out guide said it was the first time in seven years he had seen a cheetah in that part of the park, which is densely packed with trees when they prefer the wide open grounds. The final activity of the day and in Botswana was a small boat cruise on the Chobe River. We cycled around a small island full of grazing buffaloes, sunning crocs, and tons of birds. Then we got to see what Chobe is probably most well known for when groups of elephants took turns crossing the river. It was really cool to see the mother elephants look back and make sure their babies were doing okay. As soon as made it to land they covered themselves in dirt to keep the bugs away. Chobe was incredible.

We crossed by land into Zimbabwe. The border took about half an hour to get visas processed, then it was an hours drive to Victoria Falls. While popping in and out of souvenir shops on the main drag of the street a bull elephant waltz up and found some trees for a snack. Apparently he does that quite often, but it was wild to see an elephant surrounded by so much humanity after a week of seeing them in the wild. I had read about how the falls can be so strong that it creates rain and so I made everybody carry a rain coat for the entire trip to be used for no more than one hour. Then when we finally got to the walk around the falls it was as sunny as every other day. There were some areas where a little rain was produced, but the drought meant high water season was nowhere near reaching its potential. This was most obvious from the helicopter ride we took overlooking the entire falls. Still really beautiful to see, and arguably better/easier to enjoy them without getting drenched. We also got to do some ziplines and gorge swings in the shadow of the Victoria Falls Bridge. I wish that I had done the bungee jump directly off the bridge, but I‚Äôm happy to have something to look forward to on a return trip.

The final leg of the journey was a far far cry from the pit toilets of our first Xaxaba camp. We boarded Rovos Rail and took a four night trip south to Pretoria. Formal dress code at dinner, afternoon tea full of cakes, an open bar on a seventeen car train with fifty other guests. We all stayed in a type of cabin that was a couch by day and converted into a bed by night. Other rooms had more room and permanent beds. The most expensive cabin even has a bathtub. We had stops at Hwange National Park and Matobo National Park on days two and three with a full train day on day four. In Matobo we got ridiculously lucky and stumbled upon a mother white rhino and her child. The mother, under armed protection, was known as being not so aggressive, so we were able to get ten or so feet away. The young one even walked right up to one member of our group and was so close she could have reached out and patted it on the head. It was a totally insane interaction. To be close enough to a rhino to see them flick their ears and pick at the grass is the most special animal sighting I have had. It was a really fitting way to have the last activity end. Kind of overshadowed the beautiful views of the Matobo hills, which in their own right are very special. Rovos is quite expensive, and probably easy for me to say since my parents paid for it, but I do think it provided solid value. Over the course of the three day/four night trip we had seven four course meals with a wine pairing for each course. Not something that is cheap. The game drive at Hwange and tour around Matobo also come at a cost. For all of that and more to be included is going to be a lot of money. Ultimately, though, I think I would recommend against the train, especially if you are a light sleeper. There was a lot of screeching on the wheels and the train shook back and forth a lot. I lived in Ukraine for two plus years and am not a stranger to overnight sleeper trains, and Rovos far and away the most uncomfortable sleep on a train I have had. If this doesn‚Äôt bother you, then certainly go for it. It was really relaxing to look out the window, or sit on the back observation car, and watch the countryside go by. There was even the occasional elephant or giraffe not so far away from the tracks. 

All in all, it was a great trip to celebrate my parents retiring. I may have picked out everything and not given them any real say in the matter, but they enjoyed it a lot as well. ",46,2024-08-07 19:40:58,iAmTheRasputin,0.99
1fvoezl,"The Underrated Gems of C√°ceres &amp; Mer√≠da, Spain",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvoezl,421,"Extremadura is a region in SW Spain that even Spaniards don't visit that much. I was fortunate enough to visit it after completing my Camino pilgrimage in NW Spain. It is a beautiful part of the country though with lots to see and do. The food scene here is excellent, with a particular focus on pork. The world's most expensive ham, iberico, comes from here and there are meat shops everywhere.

Two of the region's gems are the cities of C√°ceres and Mer√≠da. The former has an extremely well preserved medieval city centre.  You really feel that you have time travelled back to the 14th century while you're exploring its narrow cobblestone lanes. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, you may feel it looks familiar because they used it as a filming location for King's Landing.

Mer√≠da is only an hour away from C√°ceres. It was once the capital city of the Roman province Lusitania and one of the most important cities in the Empire. There are still loads of ancient ruins scattered all over the city, such as bridges, aqueducts, temples, an amphitheatre and a theatre. If you are a Roman history but, this place is a must visit.

Both cities are easily accessible by direct train from Madrid and Seville. I can't recommend them more highly!",15,2024-10-03 21:02:32,Varekai79,0.99

I feel it starts coming off as one upping like I'm  more well traveled or I'm more worldly than you. 

I travel a lot but I really don't want others to know or care for them to know unless they ask. I know in my mind what I experienced so I'll keep it to myself.  

I don't need to tell people everything like "" oh it was so fun, you have to go, the ocean was so warm, we stayed at the nicest hotel"" but some people are like that. It gets annoying to when people talk too much about vacation when they aren't there anymore in the present. Its almost like they don't actually have anything going on ironically. 

I like talking about travel if I'm being honest and trying to relate. Like if I didn't like a place I'll say so and give them honest reasons why. Or if I went to the same place as someone else I'll ask an open ended question like what did you think about it?

Anyways this is just what I noticed. I've kind of learned to just keep vacations to myself bc thats all that matters.  Theres a way to go about it but it feels like a quick way to make people feel jealous.  I just think less is more in this situation.  Just wondering what you think?

I had never visited Hawaii before, and I decided that Oahu would probably be a good ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù island to visit, due to the sheer amount of activities. I was aware of the concerns people have about over tourism, and homelessness, but I thought both were overstated. First the good: the food is amazing, Waikiki is a fun area with tons to do, and the island is the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever been to. We rented a car, did lots of research ahead of time, and ended up doing a lot of the outdoorsy stuff on the southern half of the island. Every activity we did, from a luau, to snorkeling, to hiking, to surfing, was amazing. That being said, the crowds are crazy. Even driving an hour from Waikiki, the beaches are still so crowded there isn‚Äôt any parking. I was part of the problem, and I think that over tourism is a major issue I should‚Äôve considered more. For me personally, a bigger issue was negative interactions with the homeless. I‚Äôm no prude, and I spend plenty of time traveling in the rust belt. I see and coexist with homeless people all the time, and generally have no issues. The difference here is that the homeless population lives in permanent camps next to any tourist site (beaches, trails, shopping centers, etc). You can‚Äôt avoid them. 90% don‚Äôt interact at all, 9% beg, and 1% will harass you. The issue is that you‚Äôll probably run into dozens of homeless people every day just going to the mainstream attractions. I never ‚Äúfeared for my life‚Äù or anything, but I didn‚Äôt appreciate being followed to my car and screamed at at electric beach, or having my car being closely examined by a hostile guy who smelled like piss at the lighthouse. These people were white men, seemed like drug users, and obviously not native. I won‚Äôt talk about the causes of homelessness in Oahu, or possible solutions; but as a tourist, it was unpleasant. It‚Äôs kinda weird, I don‚Äôt see anything about that on the travel blogs. Am I being a big baby? I don‚Äôt know.

Clearly not, so thanks most of you for validating that. Happy 2024 to you all, and to all a good night. 

OP:

Currently in Vietnam in a 6 person female dorm in a hostel. It's 11:49pm at the moment and there are 2 British  girls who have been having a conversation at the top of their lungs for approx. 30 minutes. It doesn't seem like super important chat (they're talking about boys, their travels, when/where to go for food tomorrow etc).

I've been staying in hostels while traveling for the last 3 months (mainly in Europe), and most have a 'quiet time' rule, like ""lights out at 10pm to 8am"" or whatever. This place doesn't have any such rule, and I don't particularly enjoy unecessary confrontation, so l'm not sure if I should tell them to STFU or not. 

That said, I have to be up early tomorrow and would very much like a good night's sleep. The hostel is not known to be a 'party hostel' (part of the reason I booked it). I think they were up late talking last night too, but I was so jet lagged that I was out like a light and didnt really notice. I don't know if anyone else is here (there are curtains in the beds so it's difficult to tell).

So, Reddit, should I tell them to shut up or suck it up?

1fgixe8,How We Got Through My Dad's Coma in Rome,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fgixe8/how_we_got_through_my_dads_coma_in_rome/,414,"Hello all, 

Just a little less than one month ago while on vacation in Rome, Italy, my dad suffered a kidney failure.  He was admitted into the intensive care unit at the Ospedale Isola Tiberina on 8/19/24.  I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1expku0/my_dad_is_in_the_icu_at_ospedale_isola_tiberina/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1exnoq3/my_dad_is_in_the_icu_at_ospedale_isola_tiberina/) on r/rome and r/travel

When the incident happened, I was at a loss because I had no idea how I could provide support to my mom while she was away in Rome and I was in Los Angeles.  My passport was not updated.  

I posted to Reddit in a panic mainly looking to how my mom could be supported during that time.  My mom would effectively be alone within 3 days, she did not speak Italian, she did not know how to get around except via Taxi which was around $20 a ride, her hotel, a Best Western was $170 a night, she needed her own meds.    
  
Long story short, my mom got through with it from my sister and I communicating with their travel insurance company, help with connections her sister had in Rome, my brother-in-law, and me being able to make a trip to Rome.  My dad was able to improve from being in a coma for about one week to walking through LAX on 9/12/24 (with assistance) 

As we were experiencing this situation, my mom, sister, and I would talk about different things from Reddit that she could try.    
  
This post is essentially about what worked and what might've been helpful to know at the time.  


* **Buying the insurance when buying their plane tickets for ITA airways was the single most important thing they did.**  We ended up emailing FALCK or whoever Generali Global Assistance. The company helped contact my dad's medical insurance, Kaiser, who helped fund his hospital stay and helped make arrangements.  This did take lots and lots of follow-up, emails, and coordination with my sister and me**.**    
* **Make sure to leave usernames and passwords somewhere people can access.**   My dad is better and once he woke up he tried using his phone but essentially locked himself out of his iPhone.  He can't remember his apple username, password.  As I type this out, I still need to help him figure this out.  However, my sister and I were able to help pay bills on their mortgage, electricity, gas, cable, etc, and put to rest any concerns my mom and dad had while being away.  At least my dad was organized enough with his bills that we could assist.  
* **My mother got the majority of help navigating Rome from one of her sister's connections in Rome.**  This individual was able to help my mother use the Roma Atac and pointed her towards neighborhoods from which they would be able to affordably commute to the hospital.  Previous to this, she would travel via taxi.  
* **Based on learning how to commute, My brother-in-law's internet savvy helped them locate a really good AirBnB that limited their housing and transportation costs.**  My brother-in-law bought an **e-SIM Card (Airalo)** which helped my mom do Messenger while at the hospital and generally anywhere in the city.  When my mom's friends left, she was faced with the prospect of finding a more affordable place to stay.  The stay at Best Western cost them $170-200 a night.  For 20 days, they were able to find an AirBnB at around a cost of $2400+.  Included were things that they were able to do to carry on as if they were living in the city --- washing clothes, light cooking, dishes.  It was an absolute steal.
* **The translation app and Google translate is what helped one of the Italian-speaking doctors communicate with us.**  Translation was one of the biggest hurdles in the management of my dad's case, as my parents speak English and Tagalog with a handful of fluent English speakers who would be there about 50% of the time.  My mom had the translate app on her iPhone but she wanted my brother-in-law and me to be there using those apps and communicating some things with the doctor and staff.  Only towards the end of our stay did she begin using the translate app on her phone.  Based on Reddit suggestions, my mom really looked hard for the ufficina di stranieri and the US consulate but did not find any ufficina at the Ospedale Isola Tiberina and the US Consulate simply said she could hire a translator.      
* **To get my own expired US passport updated, I got the best response and a lightning-quick response from emailing my local congressman. I** emailed my local congressperson under life-or-death emergency on a Friday, who set up an appointment for me the next-coming Monday.   I was able to get a passport by Weds.  The turn-around time to physically getting a Passport was 3 days!  If I would have known the turn-around time, I would have left earlier.  
* **The Lime Scooters and Bikes are kind of costly, but did make moving around the city a little easier for me.**  I was able to find cheaper and higher-quality food than the McDonalds that they became accustomed to during their stay.  Special shouts to that restaurant **Walk to Wok.**   
* **I took a leave of absence from my work doing my best to communicate the situation with them.**  At the time I requested a leave of absence my dad was still not awake, but there was hope that he was gaining consciousness and awareness of my mother's presence.  I committed to working at least a week and then gave myself about 3 weeks to get it sorted out. My employer requested not only a doctor's note, but had their own leave of absence form.  About 2 or 3 nights that I had gotten there, I spent a long night on my iPhone's Translator app trying to explain all the questions on the form they wanted the doctors to sign.  I even wrote a letter communicating that this letter was critical for my employer.  I was able to get the forms signed by these doctors in Italy!",58,2024-09-14 05:15:31,bweapons,0.95

1dyxpnz,Filling in ESTA citizenship question if I was a citizen of a country that no longer exists,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dyxpnz/filling_in_esta_citizenship_question_if_i_was_a/,403,"UPDATE: I made some calls to Croatia and it turns out I am actually still a citizen! They simply converted my Yugoslavian citizenship into a Croatian one, so I just had to state on the ESTA that I'm still a Croatian citizen. Problem solved, and ESTA application approved! Thanks for your tips, everyone!

Hello,

I am an Australian citizen trying to apply for an ESTA so I can visit the USA for the first time in a couple months, but I'm not sure how to fill in the information for the question ""Have you ever been a citizen or national of any other country"" due to limited input options.

I was born in Knin while it was part of Yugoslavia, in the late 1980s, and my family and I left the country in October 1991. I never returned there. To my understanding that means I was a citizen of Yugoslavia, but the country no longer exists because it broke apart in the early 90s. Knin is now part of Croatia, which gained independence from Yugoslavia after I left.

When I selected ""yes"" for the question I mentioned, I was given a limited selection of countries from a list which does not include Yugoslavia. I thought that maybe I should I select Croatia instead, since that is where Knin is today, but I never applied for citizenship in Croatia and don't have a date of citizenship renouncement to enter as asked because of this.

I tried reaching out to CBP via e-mail for help, but they ""closed"" my inquiry without any relevant response (just an automated reply suggesting reading their FAQ).

Has anyone encountered a similar issue before, and can anyone please advise me on how to proceed with this question on the ESTA application? Or is there maybe a phone number I could call to have this resolved?

Thank you in advance to anyone that can help!",65,2024-07-09 03:59:14,DNW8,0.97

1bhdi0d,Corrupt police and airport scam vent (Cancun/Tulum) ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bhdi0d/corrupt_police_and_airport_scam_vent_cancuntulum/,405,"I just came back home from a 10 day trip that included Cancun, Isla Mujeres, PDC, Cozumel, Tulum, Chich√©n itza, Valladolid, Coba ruins, etc. Overall a great trip but I have to vent a little and maybe give a heads up to others planning to go there.

Everything was great with no problems until the day before we were flying out. The 4 of us were driving in a rental car trough the police checkpoint right by Rio Secreto. They pulled us over because one of the passangers in the back was not wearing a seat belt. The cops actuality pulled us over at the same place 2 days earlier, had a dog sniff the car and let us go that time because they didn't have anything obvious to 'charge' us with that time. Anyway, this time they pointed out the seat belt. Asked for my ID which I gave to him. At this point it's the same old story I've read on here so many times. Give us cash for the 'ticket' and you can go. He asked for 2000 pesos. I told him we didn't have any cash. We did, but I've read these forums enough not to say that. At this point it was 30 minutes of them holding my ID hostage and intimidation. He said if we don't pay then he will take my ID and can pay a much bigger fine at the station to pick it up. I told him, no. I will not leave my ID with him. He can write me a ticket if he wants but Im not leaving my ID. All the while one of them was standing  behind me,  taking out his handcuffs and constantly opening and closing them making clicking noises. That made me a bit nervous but I knew it was intimidation and I ignored him. Anyway, one of my friends had the good idea to call our amazing Airbnb host to see if she can help. None of us spoke fluent Spanish but She did and was able to talk the guy into letting us go. That almost killed all of our moods but Cozumel right after made up for it.

The NEXT day I returned our rental car at europcar and the shuttle driver was supposed to take me and my wife to terminal 2. He took us to 3 instead (I even looked to see as we approached but could not see any obvious signage!) and probably worked with the scammer that approached us as I was entering the terminal. He asks which airline we are ging to and went with us to the board with the flights to check and tells me it's at terminal 2. I'm like, yeah I know it's terminal 2, i thought I WAS at terminal 2. I realized that pos shuttle driver dropped me at the wrong one even though I specifically asked him if this was 2.

At this point the scammer takes me outside to the taxi area and tells me there's a free shuttle here I can take but it'll be here in 30 or so minutes. He knew I was in a big rush to catch my flight so he said a taxi would be much faster. Taxi guy came over and says he'll take me for $40. Told him no way. Ok he'll do it for $20. At this point I knew they were screwing with me even as the scammer pointed at his 'official' badge and told me to trust him. I'm also super pissed because I already had that bad experience with the cops trying to extort us.

I ditched the scammer and went back in the terminal to ask a person working for an airline to how far away the other terminal is and which direction to go and they pointed us in the right direction. We walked there in less than 10 minutes and easily caught our flight but man did that and the police shakedown leave a bad taste in our mouths from what was otherwise an amazing trip. In the end we just wanted to get the hell out of there.

Thanks to this and the Tulum subredit for preparing me a bit for these encounters. I apologize for the long read but I really had to vent.

Edit: I posted this in the Cancun subreddit a couple of days ago but figured it might help or entertain some people here as well. Yes my friend absolutely should have had his seat belt on and we'd have gladly paid a legit ticket but not a shakedown. We were also triple charged at a gas station on the way to the airport. Scams galore in M√©xico but overall I enjoyed my time there despite that. ",67,2024-03-17 19:28:35,konnal0,0.92

18wo0ff,Fun Tips on How to Deal with Corruption While Traveling,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18wo0ff/fun_tips_on_how_to_deal_with_corruption_while/,398,"How to deal with corruption, a fun guide!

Some people in another thread seemed to like my how to avoid corruption tips, so I put together a post!

Corruption should not deter you from traveling to most countries. There are some notable exceptions like DRC where you really want to know what you are doing but in general, once you get used to it, corruption is a fun game in which you get to know locals. I detest corruption for what it does to the local economy but not traveling helps no one.

The below is a summary of years of extensive traveling in some of the most corrupt countries in the world. There‚Äôs no definite guide and it‚Äôs extremely situationally dependent but it‚Äôs my best shot at summarizing some tips, hopefully you enjoy the read!

Ideally start with a kind of corruption country and work our way up as you gain experience. It‚Äôs a skill that can easily be learned.

The below is for countries with truly high levels of corruption, think Mozambique, Afghanistan, Mexico, Zambia etc. My record was 23 corruption encounters in a single day in Mozambique, which I highly recommend you visit, it‚Äôs amazing and the corruption can be easily dealt with and they are super friendly (even while shaking you down).

Corruption you encounter traveling can largely be separated into three categories:

1. Bribing: You in fact have committed a (real) crime and got caught. This includes getting caught with drugs, hitting someone with a car, having overstayed your visa etc. and are trying to bribe a cop to get out of well deserved trouble. Do not do that. None of the tips below apply to this situation and I in no way encourage it. If you committed a crime, get a lawyer and call your embassy. Bribing officials could make your situation a lot worse.
2. Extortion: this is the extremely common scenario this whole post is about. Unlike in the above, you in fact did nothing wrong, but the cop will pretend you did in order to try and make you pay a fine that they will pocket. This could include minor infractions like speeding tickets but also includes all kinds of fun and absurd stuff like: your car was overloaded (this will inevitably be followed by a massively overloaded truck blowing past you while the cop tries to tell you this with a serious face), your brand new tires are too old (in a country where the cop car‚Äôs tires are 30 years old and totally bald) etc. I find this by far the most common while driving but it can also happen at embassies trying to get a visa and any other government encounter.
3. Armed robbery by the police: this is extremely uncommon except in some of the worst parts of the world and is clearly different from #2. In #2 they will generally be very friendly. In this scenario they will be sticking guns in your face or make a clear threat of violence. You are being robbed. This also applies if they chuck you in prison at which point you‚Äôve been kidnapped. Pay them what they ask and get to safety. Again, this is extremely rare and has luckily never happened to me. Beware if a cop that starts out as #2 but is drunk (which in some countries they frequently are) or on drugs, it could escalate. Don‚Äôt drive at night to minimize drunkenness issues.

How do you recognize corruption?

You would know if you‚Äôd committed a real/major crime so we will assume you are not in a bribery scenario.

Generally speaking the good news is that it‚Äôs largely irrelevant if you‚Äôve violated a real rule (entirely possible) you just don‚Äôt know about or if the cop is making things up. All the below applies for both scenarios.

Many countries are so corrupt that they have tons of official rules on the books that are hard/impossible to comply with, specifically created by corrupt officials to create corruption opportunities.

If you are in a very corrupt country, it‚Äôs largely a fair assumption that most cops / officials will be corrupt. If you are from the US or Europe, you might assume that the cop that is hustling you is just a bad egg but everyone else is legit. This is not how things practically work out. In a corrupt system, everyone will be incentivized to only hire others they know are also corrupt. If you are a corrupt police chief, you‚Äôll make sure all your officers are corrupt for two reasons:

1. Because you don‚Äôt want anyone not-corrupt around that might try to report / ruin your corruption gig.
2. The people below you will pay you kickbacks. The traffic cop that is hustling tourists out of $20 will have some sort of a kickback scheme where a percentage of the bribes he gets are paid up to his boss, who will pay to his boss etc. These roles are sold and effectively small businesses inside the government.

The above is also why, generally speaking, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to report corruption. They might have an official anti corruption bureau or something along those lines but as a tourist you‚Äôll have no clue if those people are corrupt. Trying to report corrupt can lead to the reporter being accused of having tried to bribe the officer as retaliation. I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt report it, I‚Äôm merely pointing out it can be very difficult or entirely unfeasible.

Very important: if you get stopped by the police or some other government official (in many African countries each checkpoint will have a cop, a soldier and an immigration officer plus various other agencies) do NOT use what would be good advice in the US. Do not refuse to answer questions. Do not video the encounter (videoing military and police is often illegal). Do not insist on a lawyer. Do not insist on some right you might or might not have. All of these things will certainly make things worse, not better. You do not want to spend months in a prison somewhere, without food (in many countries no food is served in prisons, your family is expected to bring it to you!) while contracting malaria just to insist you are right.

Okay, after all the terrifying sounding disclaimers, on to the fun part how to avoid and have fun with it!

First, you have to realize they are doing this to feed their family. They might have an annual salary of $500 and their kids would starve if they were honest. This doesn't excuse it, but certainly puts me into a more empathetic frame of mind.

They are basically running a small service business. Their goal is to maximize their revenue. Every car that goes by their checkpoint is a potential customer. They pull over who they think will be the best customer. Your job when being pulled over is to make it clear that you will be an extremely unprofitable but friendly customer. The way to do that is to make it clear that they will have to spend HOURS on selling you to bribe them and even then you probably won‚Äôt pay up. While they are servicing you, all those sweet other cars that could be potential revenue will be buzzing by them. They do the opportunity cost math if it‚Äôs better to stick with you or move on to the next person.

What makes them think you are a good customer: you seem rushed or in a hurry to get somewhere. They will think if they delay you an hour or two, you‚Äôll HAVE to pay to get to wherever you‚Äôre rushing off to. Looking rich doesn‚Äôt help but generally isn‚Äôt a problem either.

Generally most officers realize that being friendly doesn‚Äôt make them less likely to get paid but reduces hassles or you trying to report them or doing something crazy. They largely just want to have a pleasant day at work, make a decent living and go home to their kids.

If you are an asshole or condescending to them, they will switch from: how do I offer a customer service that gets me paid to: Fuck this guy, who does he think he is, I‚Äôm a cop and right now I don‚Äôt care about making money so I‚Äôll make his life miserable. This is nearly always completely avoidable.

To illustrate how this play out, here‚Äôs the basic scenario and a real story: I was driving from Tete in northern Mozambique down to Maputo, the capital. I was doing nothing wrong, all my paperwork was in order, no speeding or anything.

First and possibly the most important tip is how to know when you have to get pulled over. This is country specific and quite nuanced so it‚Äôs more of an art than a science. For Moz, there were police checkpoints every 1-5km (some years back there were bandits on that road, which the government solved by having loads of checkpoints, which caused tons of corruption but no more bandits!). This is the day I got pulled over 23 times.

Minimizing getting pulled over is key. The general setup is this: 1-10 officers (it‚Äôs usually a mix of the various agencies) will be sitting on those funny little lawn plastic chairs in the shade next to the road relaxing. If they see a foreigner coming (locals get extorted as well, but foreigners are the big prize), they will inevitably jump out of the chair and start waving you down. They‚Äôll all have AK‚Äôs and official uniforms so this can be somewhat intimidating.

For Moz, the trick is if they are just in the process of getting up, you can literally smile at them, pretend like you think they are waving hello to you, wave back at them and just keep driving. IF there is a cop that is standing in the road, do not swerve around them or anything, you have to stop. Sometimes they just lazily sit there, if you slow down they WILL get up and hassle you, if you just keep going they won‚Äôt care.

They do not have cars so they can‚Äôt follow you, but they do have phones and can call the next checkpoint. Do not run from the cops. It‚Äôs hard to explain the nuance between running a checkpoint and politely ignoring it but it definitely exists and will be different by country.

I would say this works about 50% of the time (my stops that day would have doubled if I‚Äôd stopped every time).

So, then you get pulled over by a cop you couldn‚Äôt avoid. First and foremost, expect the officer to be extremely friendly and be the same. Often they won‚Äôt have made up their mind yet how they‚Äôll pitch you, and you can avoid issues by starting to talk first.

Behave like they are a long lost friend of yours and you are PSYCHED to see them. Nothing would have made your day better than meeting this exact cop, at this exact god forlorn checkpoint in the middle of nowhere. Talk about anything utterly irrelevant. The weather, how beautiful their country is etc. Crucially, try to work in how amazingly hospitable people in this country are. Most countries pride themselves on being hospitable, and the cops don‚Äôt want to violate hospitality either so this puts you into a better position.

Do not talk about what they want to talk about, which is what you supposedly did wrong and why you should give them money. Do not seem scared, in a hurry or annoyed. Definitely don‚Äôt be condescending.

Many times, probably around 70%, if you are friendly and talkative enough they will just let you go (maybe after checking your passport or something simple). Talking a bunch makes it clear you‚Äôre not in a hurry, which is by far the most crucial piece besides keeping things fun and friendly.

So then let‚Äôs say the above didn‚Äôt work and they think they might get some money out of you. They will come up with literally any excuse and they usually don‚Äôt bother making it realistic. This can be to say there is a fine for driving on too old tires, not being bothered by your tires being brand new, while the tires on the car parked right next to you are 30 years old and bald. Speeding is always a favorite reason, if you did it or not is irrelevant. Ran a stop sign, car is overloaded etc.

Usually they don‚Äôt bother trying to find something wrong with your paperwork but obviously you should try to have all your paperwork in order, which can occasionally be impossible.

At first, your response to their: ‚Äúahhhh I‚Äôm horribly sorry, but your tires are too old, that‚Äôs a $500 fine‚Äù should be: ‚Äúwow this is a BEAUTIFUL village!! Is the weather always this nice?!‚Äù

This will confuse them. They might either engage with your conversation and forget about the tires (it can also work well to ask a question like is there a bakery etc) or they might keep talking about the tires. Generally, you want to stick with completely ignoring the tire issue for at least a little while.

They either then let you go, or they will get annoyed. Don‚Äôt let them get too annoyed but move on to step #2: get out and have them show you the tire that‚Äôs supposedly too old. Arguing is pointless even if they are obviously brand new. Keep trying to make conversation just about the tire. Do not acknowledge the fine. Ask for a tire store where you can get new ones, directions to the store, what kind of tires he recommends, whatever. This can last a solid 5-15 minutes. There‚Äôs a bit of an art here too, sometimes literally just getting back into your car during the conversation and driving off after waving goodbye can work just fine. Obviously that can also backfire.

Maybe about 10% of the time this doesn‚Äôt work (if you‚Äôre good at it). Then you switch to asking for the ticket. You can very friendly inquire about the rule book (they usually have one) that shows the rule. Always cloak it into some sort of an explanation that you need to know the rules so you can tell your boss or something like that. Seeing the rule book can be ideal as there‚Äôs usually the fine listed as well and it‚Äôs never what they quoted you. Fines are as low as $1 and as high as $50, rarely every above that since they are priced for local incomes.

Be super sorry and regretful and play dumb and confused. Once they have you talking about the fine, they‚Äôll either offer you a cash pay discount or just insist you have to pay it right then and there. Generally, I do not ever negotiate a fine. It‚Äôs best to just pretend to have no money at all and ask for a ticket to be paid at the bank. This avoids getting you ensnared. Alternatively you can have some very minimal cash in your pockets and very demonstratively with your best acting skills turn out your pockets and lament how broke you are (this works no matter how nice your car is, I‚Äôve seen people do it in a $200,000 rig). I‚Äôve never been searched after claiming to not have money. You can ask to pay with a credit card which will generally greatly confuse them. That gives you a great way to insist you ARE trying to pay, you just don‚Äôt have any cash. Do NOT let them take you to an atm and never get into their car, both are bad situations.

They will make a huge deal about how difficult it will be for you to pay the ticket at the police station. They will insist it‚Äôs much more expensive that way (which is usually true), that the police station is at least an 8h drive in the opposite direction that you were going (it isn‚Äôt), that it closes after sunset (it doesn‚Äôt) and you will have to wait until tomorrow etc etc. your reaction to all this is to be super excited about the amazing opportunity to get to go back the wrong way and spend your time waiting for a police officer you were really hoping to meet all along.

If you‚Äôve made it to the end of this whole thing, you will either get a ticket, they‚Äôll just let you go or they will get continuously more aggressive. If it‚Äôs the latter I would pay them before it escalates into a full violence / threat situation. This is extremely rare. If you‚Äôve been nice, you can always avoid getting in real trouble by paying so doing the above theater isn‚Äôt putting you into a worse situation. You are now being robbed.

Depending on how confident you are, my favorite trick when I‚Äôm super stuck is this: I start making tea for everyone. I pull out a kettle, a jet boil and cups for everyone. Somehow offering them tea is quite disarming and the ultimate sign you‚Äôre in no hurry. In the half dozen times I‚Äôve done this, I never finished making the tea, they‚Äôd just let me go.

If you follow the above, chances are you‚Äôll be driving away celebrating another win and adventure!

Some people might rightfully ask, why not just pay them? It‚Äôs cheap and I don‚Äôt want to waste my vacation time.

Let‚Äôs assume you don‚Äôt care about encouraging corruption, the practical problem with paying them is that they are quite likely to call their buddy at the next checkpoint down the road. They are probably friends and know each other. They‚Äôll be made aware that a sweet score is coming and that it‚Äôs worth paying extra attention to you. In a Mozambique like day of getting stopped 23 times, that‚Äôs going to be extremely expensive as each cop will ask for more than the last and it will get progressively more difficult to stop paying them.

If you are making a cash payment for whatever reason, NEVER acknowledge it‚Äôs a bribe. You are paying a fine you think is perfectly legitimate to a government official and are completely unaware of what‚Äôs actually happening. This is for two reasons:

1. While they know they are corrupt, they loath to admit it. They will be hugely offended and make a big deal of it, likely accusing you of the crime of trying to bribe them. This can rapidly go bad.
2. You want the legal cover of at least pretending that you didn‚Äôt know you were bribing a cop, even if you did it out of fear of violence etc.

General tips:

Don‚Äôt assume cops from international agencies aren‚Äôt corrupt. For example lots of borders in Africa will have interpol agents (I never figured out if they are actual interpol agents or simply pretend to be, it doesn‚Äôt much matter) that explain that your car needs police clearance to make sure it‚Äôs not stolen before crossing the border. They will never actually inspect your car nor do they have a computer to look up if it‚Äôs stolen but will try to stall you for hours to force you to pay them to sign some document you need to cross the border.

Land borders tend to be a lot worse than flying from country to country. You are generally at their mercy and they know that. Don‚Äôt show up without food, water and a book. A tent can be a good backup plan, even if it‚Äôs just as a bluff.

Crossing a land border can easily take 6-8 hours. Get there in the morning to avoid being rushed and an easy target.

Many land borders have local ‚Äúfixers‚Äù / customs agents. You pay them to make the whole process quicker. Some of the time it‚Äôs a total ripoff, some of the time they can be super helpful to navigate the paperwork. Usually there‚Äôs like 7 different counters, all of which need to be visited in a specific order but there‚Äôs no instructions what the actual order is, you might need insurance and whatever else. An agent will help you navigate this and usually charge like $20 to do it. If they charge you a couple $100, they are either ripping you off or using part of the money to bribe the right officials along the way to accelerate the process / avoid issues. It‚Äôs hard to tell which is which unless you know the border. It‚Äôs extremely helpful to ask other travelers about their experience of crossing a specific border to have this info.

If you are stuck at a checkpoint with an extra unreasonable cop, it can help to rope in some locals. Generally a crowd will assemble to watch the spectacle. If you can actively engage them, it can help a lot. Sometimes you can ask them to help translate by pretending you don‚Äôt understand the cop. If you get lucky, the right local will just straight up laugh at the cop for asking for such an unreasonable amount of money or yell at them for being a dick to you.

Some people recommend to ask them to take you to the police station to show you the rules / talk to their boss etc. In my experience this backfires more often than not, simply because now their boss also wants a bribe but this is country specific, if you think there‚Äôs a good chance their boss is legit, that might work. Also you‚Äôve just put yourself next to the prison which isn‚Äôt ideal.

Sometimes they will tell you to pay the ticket at the station they will have to keep your license or passport. Avoid that at all costs as it‚Äôll simply lead to you having to pay the ‚Äúfine‚Äù and then buy back your hostage held passport on top of that (costs about $150). It helps to have notarized copies of your passport and drivers license handy. I always try to hand them that first, it works about 50% of the time. If not, just pretend to search for your passport for 3-4 minutes to waste their time and make it clear why you handed them a copy.

Most of the above is related to getting pulled over but it applies to everything. Embassy officials shaking you down by refusing to issue a visa for some made up paperwork issues, customs officials insisting you need to declare something etc. I once was shaken down by the administration of a hospital, they made it clear that my COVID test would certainly be lost unless I paid the expedited fee.

These situations can be extremely frustrating but once you get used to it, just become a fun part of traveling! Be friendly and have fun!",148,2024-01-02 06:11:25,hausse,0.88

I‚Äôve flown a lot over the years and I can say Japan air feels leagues above any others (British airways, Air France, Aeromexico, delta, jetblue etc)",150,2024-02-06 01:24:30,indecentdisclosure,0.94

**Bolivia:**

Number of days: 17

Places visited: Uyuni, Sucre, La Paz, Copacabana/Lake Titicaca

Total Cost: $1187.29- $69.84/day

Rating: 8.4/10 (underrated)

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- Uyuni- Salar de Uyuni tour was a cool experience, did the 3d/2n tour.

\- Sucre- Beautiful town, great food

\- La Paz- Did the death road bike tour, going downhill on those small dirt roads with the huge cliffs was terrifying at first but I LOVED IT.

\- Still a lot of Inca influence

Lowlights:

\- l almost passed out on the Salar de Uyuni tour when I went in one of the hot springs

\- Can be very hard to breathe at first due to the very high altitude

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: I would say Bolivia is pretty underrated. You have to do the Salaar de Uyuni tour. I did it when the salt flats were dry so all you could see is salt for miles which looked like snow but if you do it during rainy season you‚Äôll get a cool mirror effect. It is very cold in Bolivia as they are at a high altitude. Sucre is a beautiful old town with all white buildings. In La Paz you should be careful of altitude sickness as it is the highest Capital city in the world. I highly highly recommend doing the death road bike tour for a good rush, its pretty safe but they do have landslides that may wipe out the road. Bolivia still has a huge Inca influence so it is very different from the rest of South America.

**Peru**:

Number of days: 51

Places visited: Puno, Arequipa, Cusco/Machu Pichu, Huacachina, Lima, Iquitos, Yurimaguas, Huaraz, Tarapoto, Piura, Mancora

Total Cost: $2737.92- $53.68/dayRating: 8.8/10 - party scene could be better

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- Arequipa- Beautiful town, good food. Did a tour bus ride, rode ATVs.

\- Cusco- One of the waitresses asked me out and we went on a few dates. Ended up spending 2 weeks here. Beautiful place. Road the train to Machu Pichu. Ate Cuy here (Guinea Pig)- Huacachina- Many fun activities to do here. Did sandboarding and ATVs in the sand dunes.

\- Iquitos - took the slow boat from Iquitos to Yurimaguas, 5 days, no internet, just relaxing on a hammock‚Ä¶got attacked by pirates which was an adventure.

\- Hauraz- Beautiful hike to snowcapped mountain with a lake

Lowlights:

\- Was riding a night bus from Arequipa to Cusco and the bus broke down at 2am in the middle of nowhere, no internet connection. Had to wait a few hours for a new bus to pick us up.

Overview: One of my favorite countries in South America. The landscape here is very diverse from mountains, to deserts, to jungles it has it all! The locals are pretty out going here and muy amable. For those of you that love hiking I would recommend Huaraz. If you want a jungle experience you can go to Iquitos or Puerto Maldonado. I did Iquitos because I wanted to take the slow boat up the Amazon. You can only fly to Iquitos, you can not drive. Obviously you have to visit Machu Pichu as well, I took the train and it was a cool train ride through the mountains.

Funny story - For the slow boat in Iquitos to Yurimaguas it was a 5 day journey up the Amazon. You have to sleep on a hammock and they feed you breakfast, lunch and dinner. On our second day on the river our boat was blocked by 4 smaller boats and they demanded our captain to stop so they can basically rob us. When the captain didn‚Äôt stop the attacked us with flaming bow &amp; arrows and tried to climb on board from the back. The sailors on our boat had to fight them off by throwing large sticks at their boats to try and sink them. One guy was hit in the leg but the pirates eventually backed off and we made it down the river safely. I got it all on video too!Would highly recommend Peru, theres something for everyone here.

Places visited: Cuenca, Banos, Quito

Total Cost: $717.86- $51.28/day (I also got a $320 ($220 + $100tip) chest tattoo which I did not include in the price)

Rating: 7.8 /10 (Banos and Cuenca get a 9/10)

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- Banos - So many fun activities to do, I did a Selva tour, Chiva bus, Cascadas, Bola extrema, viewpoint ride, giant swing.

\- Cuenca- Beautiful town

Lowlights:

\- Bus to Colombia border - I was robbed (money stolen from my bag) on a bus from Quito to Colombias border.

\- Quito- Felt dangerous and was warned not to go out at night

Overview: Crossed the border from Peru to Cuenca via night bus. Cuenca is a very beautiful town and it reminds me of Cusco or maybe Sucre in Bolivia. Very nice people did a tour by bus around the town. Banos was my favorite, so many fun activities to do in situated inside the mountains. I wanted to go to Cotopaxi and the Galapagos but did not have time. I will come back to Ecuador and maybe my rating will be higher. I do not recommend spending much time in Quito, it should be used as a stopover point but you should go to the Equator while you are there. I would recommend.

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- Paramaribo- Best food in South America HANDS DOWN

\- Albina- Riding the ferry boat from Albina to French Guiana

Lowlights:

\- Paramaribo - Hot as hell and filled with mosquitos, not much going on

Overview: Best food in South America hands down. A good mix of Javanese, Chinese and Indian food. Everyone here speaks Dutch. Cool colonial buildings but everything is pretty run down. Not much going on here either. Suriname is 95% jungle but I did not get the chance to go out to the jungle parts. I may come back if I have time. I only recommend if you go out to the jungle as well, otherwise not much going on.

Highlights:

\- Georgetown - Outdoor markets, everyone speaks English(creole)

Lowlights:

\- Nothing really bad happened here, just not much going on

Overview: Crossed from the border of Surinam by boat. Took a shared taxi (minivan) to GeorgeTown for $50. Everyone here speaks English but its Creole English. Walked around the city a bit but didn‚Äôt go out at night. Pretty cool people but not much really going on. Big markets down by the waterfront to checkout. Would recommend if you have time.

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\- St George - Crossing the border by fishing boat from St George to Brazil was an adventure

Lowlights:

\- Cayenne - Expensive, nothing going on, lots of homeless and hot

Overview: Rode a small boat from Albina, Suriname to the border which was a cool experience. At the border I paid $50 for a shared taxi to Cayenne. This is not a country but a territory of France. Everyone here speaks French needless to say. Not much going on in this territory, mostly used for military and a space station. Wouldn‚Äôt really recommend coming here.

Highlights:

\- Orjanestad

\- Was able to relax on the beach with beautiful views

Lowlights:

\- Orjanestad

Overview: The reason I went here is because there were no direct flights to Surinam from Colombia so I chose to fly here first then to Suriname. locals are very nice. A good place for when I‚Äôm retired but not now, expensive. Just chilled and relaxed at the beach. The locals are very nice and respectful, pretty diverse and they all speak 4 languages.

**FAQ:1.** Did you find South America to be a dangerous place?

a. Overall no, it‚Äôs not what the U.S media makes it out to be but there are some places where you should be cautious. I was physically robbed in Cartagena and had money stolen from me on a bus in Ecuador. The places I felt were most dangerous were:

i. Santiago, Chile

ii. Quito, Ecuador

iii. Cali, Colombia

iv. Medellin, Colombia (For men specifically, women here are spiking their dates drinks and robbing them, some men have overdosed and died from the spikes.) Be VERY careful when going on dates with the local women here.

b. You really just need to be smart, be aware, don‚Äôt be drunk walking the streets at night, and don‚Äôt wear flashy accessories or walk around with your phone out and you‚Äôll be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** Did you ever feel discriminated against or experienced any racism as a POC?a. I only had two negative experiences that I felt were because of my race and they were both by Chinese individuals.

i. Chinese kids running away from me like I was the devil in Paraguay

ii. Was with a Chinese market shop owner. I was standing at the register forever waiting for her to check me out and she basically never acknowledge d my presence. She just floated around doing random tasks basically ignoring me the whole time. I asked her to ring me up but she ignored me. I was going to leave until another customer came to the register (Argentinean) and then she immediately came over. She proceeded to ring up my items but she didn‚Äôt scan them, instead she entered the price herself and i noticed that she up-charged me on a few items(the price was clearly written on the items) and I called her out for it. She gave me a very stink look and put in the correct price. When I left I told her to have a good day and she said absolutely nothing to me and gave me the nastiest look.

b. Locals in all countries were very nice to me and helped me when I needed. When I tried speaking Spanish with them I received even better treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** Are you afraid you won‚Äôt be able to find a job when you return or struggle getting back on your feet?

a. No, throughout the last year I have had many friends lose their jobs and the cost of living and inflation is skyrocketing, it sounds like I chose the right time to leave. Since I already worked for 5 years, I have a Bachelors degree, 3 certifications and I am in the IT field, I am sure I will be able to at least get an entry level job and even though it may not be the same salary that I left with I am perfectly okay with that because I got it once and I can get it again.

Where am I now: Currently I am in India since for a friends wedding which I came to straight from Brazil. I will be here for a month then I am off to Thailand to start my year in SEA.

TLDR; Quit my job to travel the world for 2 years, just finished off my first year in South America where I went to every country except for Venezuela and spent a total of $23,733.

I am starting my second year of travel off in India where I will be for a month then off to Thailand for a year in SEA. I will have a budget of $24k. I have absolutely no regrets and I am having the best time of my life.",94,2023-11-29 14:56:07,-TheITGuy,0.95

In my personal experience I would say It was one of the most beautiful countries I ever visited. People were so kind and talkative, one local even payed for my dinner only because we had a good conversation. Unlike other countries you wouldn't find any desert in Lebanon. The most of the county is mountainous and you can even go skiing and experience beautiful views. Country is also full of beautiful waterfalls and historical landmarks and some of them are thousands of years old. Lebanon is the most religiously diverse country in Middle east and they have 18 oficially recognized religious sects. Local food was also delicious especially manakish and kibbeh. Lebanon was beautiful experience and one I will remember for the rest of my life.

18g2wuk,Cruise Travelers - why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18g2wuk/cruise_travelers_why/,398,"Trigger warning for serial cruise-goers

I just don‚Äôt understand the appeal of a cruise. I‚Äôve been on 2 in my life (one to Mexico from LA when I was 23, one around the Mediterranean when I was 15). Honestly, both experiences weren‚Äôt terrible per se. But cruises just seem like the worst way to ‚Äútravel‚Äù or ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. 

Why not just go to an all inclusive resort? From my perspective, there‚Äôs  literally no reason at all to be traveling via a moving mall on the ocean. Pretty much all of the ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù of a cruise can be satisfied by an all inclusive resort, where you‚Äôll also (a) have a way bigger room, (b) have more access to activities, (c) not get seasick and (d) generally have better food. You can also more easily explore the local area without being limited to a half-day at shore where you can only access a manufactured ‚Äúvillage‚Äù full of kiosks selling you junk. 

Also - there‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúsoothing‚Äù about the open ocean when you‚Äôre 4-10 stories above the water. You‚Äôre in a small mixed use commercial/residential building! You don‚Äôt even get the benefit of ‚Äúchilling‚Äù by the beach, listening to the relaxing sound of waves crashing against the beach. 

The only exception I can think of is an Alaskan cruise, where you‚Äôre able to access a physical location (glaciers) that is otherwise difficult to access via other means. But aside from that, I just don‚Äôt get it. 

So please, help me understand: why do you like to go on cruises? Im willing to change my mind if there is something I‚Äôm missing.

When asked about it to a staff, they said it'll be taken care in 5 minutes. Then our plane got delayed to around 12 and they again made an announcement saying they'll be providing lunch. Soon after they made us a literal pushover material. They said we're gonna go to the hotel have some rest and return for the flight at 22:00.

1ghmuyw,Kyiv Ukraine üá∫üá¶- Pictures+Information ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ghmuyw,398,"Thought I would just share a few insights into my observations of Kyiv, Ukraine and some pictures of the country! 

Pictures 1-5 are sights around Kyiv and some of the places that I visited. I got extremely lucky and had a lovely sunny day (out of 5) during my time there to explore the beauty. Golden gate, St Sophia and Glass bridge to name a couple of places. 

Picture 6- A memorial site where flags are planted for fallen soldiers in the war. 

Picture 7-10- The trains in and out of Kyiv. Most countries that people travel to have the ability to enter through plane. However, Ukranian airspace has been closed since the beginning of the war and thus means you have to take a train to enter. 

The sleeper train i took from Chelm-Kyiv had 4 bunks in a room and was relatively comfortable. Immigration does wake you up a couple of times at unholy hours of the night and delays are realtively common. Booking these trains you have two choices, either Polrail or the Ukranian train app. Polrail tickets must be picked up in person, while the Ukraine app allows you download the boarding pass on your phone. Polrail is around 90$.  

On the way back, there was only space on the sleeper train from Kyiv-Chop-Kosice (Slovakia) as trains frequently sell out weeks in advance. This one was in a 2 bunk configuration ‚Äúdeluxe cabin‚Äù and was realtively comfortable for the 18 hour journey. 

Uber works really well in Kyiv and so does taxis. It‚Äôs an interesting experience Kyiv at the moment (the only place I visited) as air raid alerts are constant at night but I didn‚Äôt see a single person in the shelters. Yeah, when I heard my first air raid alert, I felt I had to go into the shelter‚Ä¶ However, I didn‚Äôt notice much difference from everyday life in downtown Kyiv during the day. 

If you are looking for a really cool speakeasy, check out Loggerhead downtown!

1bbe98i,"I was ""arrested"" due to a mistake.",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bbe98i/i_was_arrested_due_to_a_mistake/,400,"I am from Portugal but during August 2023 I went to the USA with my family.

We arrived to the San Francisco airport and then we went to the car rental to find our rental car: a modern BMW that is a complete luxury for an american (think that those cars are made in Europe and then exported to the US, making them really expensive)

Edit: thanks for explaining that BMW aren't luxury, but the car was modern and new (a 2022 car)

Then we stopped in a mall because we needed to buy a T-Mobile card, and then we tried to leave but a police car stopped us and told my father to leave the car, and then they arrested my father with the handcuffs and everything, I remeber them shouting ""Get out of the car!"" and those things but they didnt point any weapon because they noticed that there were children inside the vehicle.

In Portugal I can tell you that being forced out of your car and arrested with handcuffs is as rare as winning the lottery seven times in a row, I was thinking ""what is happening next"" but fortunately nothing threatening happened next and the officers understood that something was wrong and then they told us what to do next.

I remeber when one of the officers went to the car (where I was that moment) and said to me ""you are not in trouble"".

The reason of the arrest was because they thought that the car was stolen, but in reality the car was rented in the airport to a complete legal company, their system had a mistake and they told us to not worry.

This was completely another kind of experience, I understand that American and Portuguese police are completely different because America has weapons and police can be harmed anytime while portuguese police aren't worried if someone has a weapon in their vehicle.

Also, we rented an expensive car, and I think that people that own those cars live in expensive neighbourhoods with private safety and that if a criminal wanted to steal that car it should be a very experienced and armed criminal.

But being really honest I didnt expect american police to act different when they realize things like that there are younger people with their parents or not taking us to the police station.

I swear, it's a mainstay of every single flight that provides a meal: a breadbun served in a single use plastic bag that's cold, hard, and served with practically frozen butter. I don't even know how to eat it, really, other than maybe dipping it in something soupy or with tons of sauce. I certainly can't put butter on it, cause it won't melt. And this bread seems to be present in every airline I've flown with recently, including Air France, Aeromexico, Loong Airlines, and Singapore Airlines. I think it was a mainstay pre-covid, too, since I remember trying to put cold butter on cold bread flying Canadian Airlines, KLM and South Korean Airlines, too.

So yeah, what's up with that bread? Is it really that much of a bother to put that bread bun inside a microwave for 10 seconds? Is it a budget thing? I know airlines don't actually care about the customer experience, but why can't we at least get slightly warm bread?",135,2024-02-18 06:57:30,waffledogofficial,0.9

They didn‚Äôt believe her. 

Her place is just accommodation for 2 people. I have actually stayed there, it‚Äôs gorgeous.

These criminals are charging massive amounts of money and advertising 2 apartments.

Read below what she has tried to do to get [booking.com](http://booking.com) to take it down.  


Almost three months on and I still haven't been able to get [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) to remove the fake Cottage on Dhurringile listing on their site.

I'm being treated like the criminal by them, and the scammer has all the rights!

Sadly, we had three families turn up last weekend, all with fake bookings!

I'm at my wits end! 

I approached the ABC and met with one of their journalists yesterday, who couldn't believe how [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) have handled this situation.

I was also able to put them in touch with one of the families who had a fake booking.

I'm hoping the ABC might be able to put a rocket up someone's arse, but frankly after my dealings with this company, I doubt it.

My advice,  if you make a booking with a booking platform, make sure you get something from the property owner and steer clear of Booking.com!

Also, someone who picked up that it was a scam, has now given the listing a BAD review with a 1 star rating...hopefully this might deter someone else from making a booking!

I seriously don't need this stress atm!

1g3u7si,I wish I'd stuck to solo travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g3u7si/i_wish_id_stuck_to_solo_travel/,399,"I've just gotten back from a month of travelling around Europe.

I thought I had the balance right, around 2.5 weeks travelling on my own and 1.5 with a friend.

At first it was great with my friend. Chilled, relaxed, fun. But then she got really prickly. It was clear that our pace of travel was very different. I was up and ready to go by about 8.30, wanting to beat the hottest time of the day. I do heaps of walking, averaging at least 10+ kms a day (which is a lot, but I know plenty of people do more). I do research about each place so I have a vague idea of things I want to see or areas to explore. For meals I would typically have a simple breakfast that I make myself, lunch would vary and often be something quick and on the go. Dinner I like a mix of eating out, take out or a supermarket meal I'll put together. I love trying local food.

My friend on the other hand, was a late riser, would prefer to spend nights in our shared accommodation watching netflix, rarely wanted to eat out and wasn't really well researched so it was always me coming up with ideas.

We managed our shared cost on the app Split Wise. I found she often wasn't very forthcoming in paying for her fair share, so by the end she owed me a bit of money.

We never had a fight but she got so grumpy with me. She didn't seem to want to walk anywhere. She was really moody all the time, often just going in her room at night and not saying anything. One day in the middle of our holiday I said I needed a solo day and we'd catch up that night. I wanted to do a bit of walking and knew she wouldn't be up for it, plus by then we'd spent 7 days together so I needed a break. This was something we'd discussed at home so I didn't see an issue.

After that she went from¬†*sometimes*¬†wanting to do things to¬†*never*¬†wanting to do things. On our last night together I suggested we go out for dinner, she said no, she needed to pack for her flights the next day. So I go out solo and when I get back she's in her pj's by 8 and watching netflix.

It's been 2 weeks and we usually chat all the time (pretty much daily) and I haven't heard from her once. I contacted her a week ago and she was pleasant enough but nothing since then.

I'm sure there were things about me that grated her, but not enough to end a friendship. We both love travel and are in a similar position financially and I was really hoping we could do more trips togehter, but after this experience I'm not even sure our friendship will survive.",202,2024-10-14 18:42:32,Grevillia-00,0.9

Thanks to the advice from some great people here, I made a few changes to my itinerary‚Äîmost notably staying in Marina Del Rey, LA instead of Hollywood, and visiting the Field Museum in Chicago. This trip has truly been life-changing and has altered my perspective forever. Traveling to the US has always been both a dream and a significant challenge for me. It's been a dream because of my lifelong exposure to American movies, books, and the time I‚Äôve spent reading about the U.S. economy and, of course, the fact that the U.S. is also the leading country in the world. However, it was a difficult journey because flying to North America is literally halfway around the globe for me. It took a full 24 hours from the time I left my house to finally arrive at my first hotel in the U.S. Bringing my family along meant the trip required a significant financial commitment, while I also had to ensure the safety of my kids.

But I did it‚ÄîI set foot on a new continent and completed my travels to all G7 countries and (almost) all developed nations. While these words may sound simple, what I truly feel right now is that any dream can come true, and the most valuable assets we have are our experiences‚Äîthe trips and journeys we‚Äôve taken. Our family has learned so much from this adventure, and hopefully will continue to experience new things in the future. Thank you all for giving me the confidence to make this trip a reality. I deeply appreciate it. And my favorite city, along with Tokyo, may become Chicago now.

UAE immigration laws allow a visa on arrival for B1/B2 US visa holders and I have used the visa on arrival multiple times in the past when travelling to Dubai with no issues at all.

However Air France refused to issue me a boarding pass because their system did not recognize visa on arrival as a valid Visa document and they wanted to me provide them a pre approved Visa. I would not be able to produce a pre approved Visa before 26th December since it would require manual stamping by immigration office in UAE and it was a long weekend.  
They refused to consider the fact that I was eligible for Visa on arrival. I ended up booking an emirates flight to Dubai for the next day and as expected faced no visa issues at all.

Now when I reach to out to Air France for a refund they are refusing to entertain me saying I did not have complete documents so it is not their fault.

Only after we pointed out that we could still purchase seats for the next day did United agree to book us on that flight and even promised to seat us together.

However, a few hours after receiving our flight confirmation, we discovered that they had put us on different flights. When we called back to address this, the agent told us there was nothing he could do and that there was no one to escalate the issue to. We mentioned that we could still see available seats for purchase, but he explained that those were in a different cabin class, and he couldn't upgrade us‚Äîeven after canceling our flight due to their own negligence and then booking us on separate flights.

We cited DOT regulations and everything we could find online, but he simply advised us to file a complaint with United.

It allows me to make my own decisions and I‚Äôll be the only one responsible if I, let‚Äôs say, miss a train, a flight, a bus, or smthing like that.

Long travels are even more complicated, because you gotta book the flights in advance, and worry about if you‚Äôll have time to take the connections and make it to that flight.

You gotta know what time you‚Äôll check out from that hotel, and be ready on time.

When you‚Äôre packing, you gotta make sure you have the right-size-backpack, with the right weight.

If you travel to another country with different currency then you have to switch your mind to ‚Äúthink‚Äù with that currency instead.

You gotta learn a few words in order to communicate, and some people might learn the whole language instead. 

You gotta learn how to navigate through a new system of transportation.

You gotta be creative, VERY CREATIVE sometimes when things don‚Äôt go the way you planned out, and the difference of becoming creative or not is that one can make you miss that flight, and all the other flights you had booked out to get to that destination, and perhaps all the hotels you‚Äôd carefully booked for your stay.

Travelling makes you think abt a lot of things in advance, and somehow it feels really great and rewarding when you make it to a certain destination.

Kinda like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made it, omg I‚Äôm so amazing! (modestly speaking I remind myself)‚Äù 

Now, what other things you would say travelling does to you?

I wanted to have a good time in Budapest, but just couldn't. It wasn't bad in any sense, but having been to e.g. Vienna, Prague, and a bunch of other cities in the region it just didn't stand out that much. BUT: one thing that really hit home though was the food - anything from the more stereotypically traditional Hungarian dishes and the wine, to ""new Hungarian"" cuisine and the dozens of ways to cook  catfish from Lake Balaton.

2) Conversely, many parts of upper/mountainous Central Asia, e.g. the High Pamirs in Tajikistan/Kyrgyzstan, the Wakhan Corridor bordering Afghanistan etc. were some of the most beautiful places that I have ever been to in my life, with only few other places on our planet coming close in my opinion. Despite the gorgeous scenery and the incredible hospitality of the local populations however the food has been awful. Of course, these are remote regions with limited agriculture and wide-spread poverty, but even in some of the more fertile and accessible parts of e.g. Tajikistan you'd be lucky to find more than the same 2-4 dishes done more or less well.

Any place in particular that stood out to you on either side of the scale? Any place that would make it worthwhile to visit just for the food alone, versus places that are so magnificent that even a foodie would enjoy them in spite of the lack of good food options?

1eozwos,Violent theft in broad daylight in Barcelona ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1eozwos/violent_theft_in_broad_daylight_in_barcelona/,381,"Hello Reddit community,

I am writing this post to share a horrifying experience that my family and I went through on our first day in Barcelona. There were 6 of us walking together when we had to split for a short bit due to a big van-like taxi parked on the street. At that point, my mom was in the corner of a street, with the street breaking into a small gully.

As my mom stood there for literally 5-10 seconds trying to notice the brand of the taxi, (note that this is my parents‚Äô first time in Europe, so they want to notice everything!) a man started running towards her side. She initially thought he was just jogging, but as he got closer, he pushed her , snatched her gold chains and ran away. My mom was in shock and let out a loud scream. I turned back and saw my mom holding her neck and pointing towards the running man. I tried to follow him but couldn't catch up.

The incident took place on C/ de Sant Pere M√©s Baix, 62, Ciutat Vella, 08003 Barcelona, Spain, right opposite the Musik Boutique Hotel. When we spoke to the receptionist of the hotel about the incident (to understand if there is some cctv around), he told us that thefts like this are common in the area and that there is a gang operating in the vicinity.

My mom described the thief as around 180cm tall, with black curly hair, Caucasian skinned and aged between 22-28 years old. He had a lean but strong built. It is truly disheartening to see such criminal activities being normalized in a popular tourist destination like Barcelona.

We went to the police station to complain. In the 3 hours we were at the waiting area, we saw new families from various countries, individuals (single travelers and Spanish speaking people could be locals themselves), etc. come in and join the queue to speak to the translator / staff at the reception .. every 15-20 mins! Imagine the state at other police stations all over Barcelona!

This post is a heads-up for anyone planning to visit Barcelona - watch out, and stay safe. We won't be returning, and we'll make sure to warn everyone we know about this city.

What's even more absurd is the news about locals' use of water guns to deter tourists. Seriously, water guns? Such stories and experiences are enough to deter tourists.

Edit - To all those saying that my mom should have known: first, we are beating ourselves to this second to not have noticed what she was wearing or thinking hard about everything that could have gone wrong. And since this is someone‚Äôs first day in a European country and this person is old and not well travelled, I didn‚Äôt expect this person to be super aware and prepared. My parents hail from India and they have only looked up to Europe as a whole. But I agree that I should have been more prepared to get stolen from, mugged, check my pockets every minute, look at everyone with a suspicious eye, be paranoid about everyone around me scheming to pick pocket us, etc. Sadly enough, im not even being sarcastic!

Second, there were Spanish speaking people coming to the police station every 30-45 mins we were there apart from the international tourists. Some had their wallets stolen, entire bags or phones. So this is more than just ‚Äúhey tourist, do you not know what you‚Äôre getting into?‚Äù. I hope people that live in the city don‚Äôt put all the responsibility on tourists to not wear gold chains or carry phones or wallets, but really tackle this!",277,2024-08-10 13:28:46,Difficult-Mulberry21,0.79

1gjiwa8,Luxor (Egypt),https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gjiwa8/luxor_egypt/,382,"Using a burner account to share my experience.

Past weekend, I decided to travel to Luxor from our holiday in Hurghada with my girlfriend since it was a long time dream of us to visit the capital of ancient Egypt (we're both into history).

To give you an idea on our background, we're both beginning of our 30s and have travelled to about 40+ countries together (North Africa, Latin America, South East Asia etc.). Look wise we're olive skinned Mediterranean (I'm from a Balkan country, she's mixed Spanish/Moroccan), so we're not the typical ""target"" for locals. Additionally, my girlfriend purposefully dresses down to be moderate and not draw attention and I have tall, athletic build.

Both of us have grown up with quite thick skin because of the environment where we were raised, so the poverty, hassling, negotiating prices everywhere you go, getting ripped off, etc. did not really come off as a major shock to us. However, we had an awful encounter regretting our visit to this country. 

**Story time:** During the day, we visited all the different monuments on the East Bank and, beside the usual stuff I read on Reddit happening to tourists in Egypt, nothing more happened. The hotel staff, our driver, the employees at the various tourist sites were all friendly and helpful, so far so good and a great experience for history geeks like us.

After dinner at our hotel's restaurant around 7pm, we decided to take a walk on the boardwalk near the Nile (where all the cruises are anchored). After a nice long walk, we decide to have a drink at a caf√© on the boardwalk. At this point (9pm), there were pretty much only locals outside walking around and/or having a drink. Mostly men, so again the staring, remarks in Arabic, etc. was more than prevalent, but fine, we just ignore it to not spoil our day because there is not end to it, right? When asking for the bill a kid (aged 11-12) from a distance started to blow kisses, hearts, etc. to my girlfriend. Since it was a child, we were thinking nothing more to it than again an example of lack of education and respect which we experienced during our walks in Hurghada on a previous holiday before.

After we paid the bill, we decided to walk home the same way we came, so this same kid starts to haggle us for food, then for a drink, then eventually for money. We ignore it and keep on walking towards our hotel. We had to take a turn on a road where there was limited lighting and only cars passing by, so we kept walking and ignoring him to reach another main road when he suddenly started to run in front of us, picked up a big rock and started to shout aggressively and threatened to throw it on us. Seeing this unfold, my girlfriend panicked because my first reaction was to let go of my girlfriend and walk towards him to fuck him up when she grabbed and pushed me back reminding me that it's a minor and if I hurt him (which I was intending to do, because I was not going to let someone threaten her or me), I might end up in jail if something happens etc. So she calmed me down and urged me to walk back quickly to the boardwalk where we came from to have some people around us. And so we did. He followed us all the way back to the boardwalk, but with the rock hidden in his hoodie. I decided to talk to one of those horse carriage drivers to take us back to the hotel hoping it would solve the issue of crossing the road we need to cross to get to the hotel. All said and done, we arrive at the corner of the street of our hotel and we hop off the carriage. 

Guess what? Suddenly this kid appears again out of nowhere. Most likely he ran and chased the carriage down for nearly 1,5km.

At this point, we told the driver to call the Tourism Police and pointed to the kid out saying he chased us all the way down. The driver (after asking for a tip of course) walked us to the hotel entrance where we immediately went inside to tell the reception what was going on. The kid then walked by the entrance and when seeing that there was a guard in the entrance finally decided to give up and disappeared. Reception said they can call the police, but it would be impossible for the police to find him again since it's dark and nothing ""serious"" happened to us. Basically, it would just be a waste of time to file in a report etc. and advised us not to go walking alone by the evening again. We barely slept that night and left first thing in the morning.

I hope this experience will help anyone considering to visit Egypt to plan their trip like many suggested: **with an experienced, local tour guide who drives you around from point A to B. Do to not go on walks in the late evening by yourself thinking you'll be fine.** The harassment, hassling and uncomfortable feeling of being unsafe is multiplied by 100 when it's dark, even as a couple, so let alone for solo female travelers.",135,2024-11-04 10:48:23,Thin-Concern3375,0.89

1buuz41,What's the worst you've been ripped off?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1buuz41/whats_the_worst_youve_been_ripped_off/,373,"For me it was in Bratislava in Slovakia in about 2004.

I was going to a football (soccer) match and had booked a trip that included a hotel and a ticket. In a time before Google maps we didn't really know where the hotel was, but I made a note of the address and texted it to myself.

Our flight was getting in about 1:30am which wasn't ideal but ok, it meant we needed to get a taxi we went out to the Taxi rank.

I showed my address to the first driver, he puffed out his cheeks and shook his head to say ""No""

Moved on to the second car, he did the same. We were getting a bit worried at this stage as we weren't really sure what our options were in a foreign country where we didn't speak the language in the middle of the night,

We moved onto the third car, this driver too puffed out his cheeks but  then \*reluctantly\* agreed to take us. We'd been told to negotiate a price before getting into the car and not to use the meter but when we asked he just shook his head and said ""meter, meter"". Again we didn't feel like we were in a strong position here so we agreed.

We didn't have a whole lot of money with us as it was hard to get Slovakian crowns, our plan was to use a beuro de change at the hotel but myself and my friend both worked with a Slovakian who had sold us some money so we had a bit each.

On the ride we were watching the meter tick up and starting to get worried but eventually we got to the hotel and we agreed that one of us would stall him in paying while the other one got the bags out of the back of the car, we knew we were being ripped off but didn't want to get robbed too.

We paid, got our bags and went into the hotel, where a very friendly lady on reception gave us a cheery ""hello"".  To be honest, my reply wasn't great, instead of saying hello back I just asked how much a taxi should cost from the airport. I can't remember the number in Slovakian Crowns, but I worked out the currency exchange at the time and the price she said was about ‚Ç¨15. 

We'd paid ‚Ç¨75

She asked what we'd paid, and when we told her she went running out of the hotel looking for him but he was long gone. She apologised, but obviously it wasn't her fault and she checked us in.

Maybe the worst part was the next morning, we ordered a taxi from the hotel to the city center and the price came to about ‚Ç¨5, so we were right beside the city and those first two drivers who refused to take us were obviously in on it to make us feel desperate. 

In the grand scheme of things, it wasnt too bad, we had money we didn't end up having to budget the rest of the trip and we just chalked it up as a lesson learned. It's obviously easier these days to plan in advance exactly how to get from the airport to your hotel.",327,2024-04-03 10:08:24,Walnuts364,0.92

1fmhzpy,I got robbed by a hostel in Madrid,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fmhzpy/i_got_robbed_by_a_hostel_in_madrid/,373,"I saw a similar post on here and reminded me of my story about a hostel I stayed at in Spain years ago that you might enjoy.

I booked a hostel online in Madrid before my vacation on a weekend trip.  My Spanish is good enough to get by, as you'll see later on in the story, but no where near fluent especially with native speakers.  I get to where my hostel is supposed to be but something else is there now.  I see a hostel across the street so I go to them and ask where my hostel is because it doesn't look to be there.  They told me it recently closed and they have room for me there if I want.  I was young and in a new country so I said sure, that sounds good.

This part is a little hazy but I seem to remember other hostels having a special place to put your bags.  They tell me they've had a few bags stolen recently so if I want, they'll hold my bag and put it in the office so no one can steal it.  My last night there, I gave them my bag to keep safe overnight with my wallet in it.  I wake up to go to the airport, grab my bag and leave.

I get to their subway system and pull out my wallet to pay for the train and I notice all of my money is missing.  I know I had close to 100 euros in it.  Luckily I left really early and the train stop was really close to my hostel.  So I went back to my hostel and asked them what happened to my money?  I had plenty before bed when I gave you my bag and now it's all gone. For the first time since I've gotten there, their English isn't good and they aren't sure what I'm saying so I tell them in Spanish.  The guy at the front desk talks to his coworker in Spanish back and forth for about a minute straight.  I am not good at understanding when natives talk quickly between each other so I have no idea what they were saying.  After they were done talking, all they said to me was 'sorry, we don't know'.

I have no cash, my flight is coming up really quickly, I have no idea where the nearest ATM is.  I decide the best action is to just jump the turnstiles and hope I don't get caught.  I do that successfully and get on the train heading to the airport, I think I'm set and I navigated this situation nicely...but no.  Madrid does things differently, once you get to the airport on the train, you have to pay again to enter the airport.  I had never seen that before in my previous travels.  I go through my bag, trying to find loose change because it wasn't that much to get in.  In hindsight, I probably should've just asked someone for the money but I didn't. 

I have the genius idea that I will just get back on the train, go one stop down and walk to the airport.  It can't be that far, right? Wrong. The next stop was in a more rural area, definitely not touristy and not a lot around there.  I end up walking in the direction of the airport but I can't see it and there are no signs for it.  I find this friendly stand that sells random items but they speak no English at all.  I'm trying to talk to them with my limited Spanish, we understand each other enough and they give me directions that I kind of understood (I was way further from the airport than I thought).  

I walk for a little bit and I see the airport! But there's one problem, there's an 8 lane highway between me and the airport and it was busy.  So I just kind of stood there until there was enough space for me to sprint across this huge highway while cars are coming at 70mph.  I made it across but I was more by the runways than the terminals so I have to walk for about 15 minutes where people clearly aren't supposed to walk and eventually I made it to the terminal on time and caught my flight.",92,2024-09-21 20:25:34,Molarmite,0.88

We also eat twinkies and other American-like pastries, they're just named different. Look ""submarinos"" it's a twinkie and I always ate them at school.

However, we never hear Europeans complain about our bread. How about SE Asia? they are also not bread, cheese or chocolate nations.

Then why does the US is so remarked for bread? Why do their bread have to be top quality when they eat different things too?

1f6jptj,Trip to Northern Ireland and Ireland. Summer 2024,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f6jptj,361,"

This trip was a continuation of my European escapade, and followed my somewhat spontaneous trip to Iceland on a USAF C-17. 

Leaving Iceland the flight to Edinburgh was diverted to Glasgow due to another plane having an issue on the runway in Edinburgh, so after a delay, and a few maintenance issues of our own in Glasgow, we were back on our way. Once we arrived in Edinburgh, we proceeded to customs, while waiting in line is where my entire trip got put on its head! My daughter tells my wife she doesn‚Äôt have her passport. We search through all our bags, and she tells us, she‚Äôs sure she left her passport on the plane in the seat back in front of her‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ We let the border agents know, so they can have someone check the plane, as they won‚Äôt let us back on the tarmac. We were told the plane was already cleaned and nothing was found. But the border agent helping was one of many awesome people we met during our journeys. He arranged a temporary card that allowed my daughter to progress through. But now we were concerned about our connecting flight to Belfast. Thankfully since Scotland and Northern Ireland are part of the UK the temporary card was accepted to continue on. Before we checked our bags, we asked the ticket agent to check again about the lost passport, and we were told the plane was in the air heading to Italy. So at this point the rest of our trip is in jeopardy. But on we travel!

Northern Ireland was great! Though I admit I was intimidated about driving on the opposite side of the road, and adding in we had a big Volvo XC90 on the narrow back roads of NI. Due to availability and weighing the cost, we booked two AirBnB‚Äôs for our stay. The 1st was a wonderfully remodeled home with an ocean view near Ballywalter. The second home was another well done remodeled home, but a farmhouse this time. The owner‚Äôs mother greeted us to let us in, I would guess she was in her 80‚Äôs. But she was the kindest, sweetest lady! Yeh it was an odd request, but I asked to get my picture taken with her üòÑ (which she happily obliged). She walked me around her property and gave me the history of the home. Driving around, the green beauty of NI never disappointed, though the clouds, never really went away. The main reason for picking NI was so that I could see friend‚Äôs I‚Äôve had since 1998. We did a Belfast bus tour, visited National Trust sites: Carrick-a-Rede, the Giants Causeway, and threw in a ferry ride to The Republic of Ireland (Dundalk). The rope bridge at Carrick-a-Rede definitely took some trust, and my friends sons who joined us for this outing shaking the bridge while going across didn‚Äôt help. Really wish we could have gooten some blue skies, but even with the overcast the views were still awesome. The hike/walk was easy, and there were minimal crowds. The Giants Causeway was a little longer of a hike, and had some decent elevation changes (we didn‚Äôt take the bus down). There were more people at this site but it still didn‚Äôt seem over crowded. Once we got to the legendary ‚Äúfootsteps of giants‚Äù as luck would have it my friend ran into an old acquaintance that worked there as a guide, so we got a semi-private history telling of the area. Both locations give you an impressive view or the northern coastline of NI. The ferry ride to the Republic of Ireland as kind of a last minute addition. But I didn‚Äôt want to make my way all the way to NI and not get to at least cross into Ireland. Unbeknowst to my family and I it was a Bank Holiday in Ireland, so many places were closed. But since we were on the clock to catch the ferry back to NI we didn‚Äôt really have a ton of time anyway. We still got to walk around the city of Dundalk, and see take a few photos. And while I‚Äôm not normally a fan of bus tours, the tour of Belfast was actually very enjoyable. We sat on top of the double decker buss (of course we did! üòÜ), and the tour guide was quite informative. Betweeen the tour guide and visiting the local museum I gained a whole new perspective on ‚ÄúThe Troubles‚Äù truly was sad to hear some of the things that the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland went though. All said I was glad to have taken the bus tour and appreciate the experience. 

I was enjoying my trip, all the while still concerned about the passport issue. The Border Force had contacted me to confirm the passport was indeed found in Edinburgh (arghhhhhh!!!!!!), and that they were mailing it to us in NI (I requested I pay for expedited mail, never heard back). We canceled our trip to the US Consulate because we thought the passport would arrive in time (it‚Äôs under a 30min flight from Scotland to NI). We later realized it would have been better to just have them hold it there since we were coming through Edinburgh again anyway. All that to say, we were waiting at my friends home watching for the mailman just hours before our flight (already booked along with a follow on flight with a no refund option). FINALLY, the mailman shows up, but to our disappointment no passport. So we go through our contingency options, along with a hopeless call to the consulate. And while on the phone, pleading our case, they tell us they can get us in same day (we really only had about 4hrs to play with), but we need passport photos in hand. So we jump in the rental and try to find a place to get passport photos taken, thankfully by this point, I had gotten used to driving on the other side of the road, because every second truly counted! We got the pictures, and headed to the consulate where of course parking wasn‚Äôt allowed. So I get out next to the consulate and have my son take over driving so my wife and daughter can go inside (now I‚Äôm worried about the rental, as he‚Äôs never driven in the UK üòÖ). Once inside the staff there gets nothing but a rave review from me. Though when I told them our flight time, they were pretty skeptical we‚Äôd make it, but due to their quick work we were able to get an Emergency Passport done! Thankfully my son had no issues the hour or so we were gone. Turned in the rental slightly late, but we made our flight, just barely! Flight back to Edinburgh went without issue, though we were delayed again at customs, as we didn‚Äôt know until the last second my daughter was too young to use the same line as the rest of the family, so she had to go to the back of another line. But we were able to collect our bags, get them transferred for our next flight to Venice.

1e8t94o,A rant about Airbnb rants,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e8t94o/a_rant_about_airbnb_rants/,372,"I'm tired of reading them. You had a bad Airbnb experience. Bummer. It happens. Please stop posting about it. Unless it's an epic story of double-booking with a furry group or finding a dead body in a closet, it's already been told. I just read a post where the main complaint was the unit didn't have any windows. Did you not look at the photos?! The risks of Airbnb are well-known. The service is highly decentralized. Each place has it's own owner. There isn't a front desk agent ready to make things right. 

Airbnb, compared to a chain hotel, is risky. With a hotel, especially from a reputable chain, you know exactly what you are going to get. A soulless room with artwork that often sits at the bottom of the uncanny valley. A liminal space with no past or future. But it will usually be clean, quiet, and most importantly, if something goes wrong there is someone on site who can assist you. Airbnb doesn't have that. 

Airbnb has a much higher ceiling and lower floor than hotels. I've probably stayed in 30 Airbnbs (or Vrbos/vacation share, etc.) in my life. The top five are some of the best places I've ever stayed. The bottom five are some of the worst. The same, but not as drastic, could be said for independently owned hotels vs. chain hotels (I actually booked a hotel room in Italy once that didn't have any windows, something I didn't realize till right before check-in). An independent hotel will leave you in the lurch far more often than a big chain, but local hotels have a charm and character that no international brand can replicate, despite their attempts with ""autograph"" or ""signature"" collections. 

Airbnbs are often a better value. The gap has narrowed in the last five years, but still, compare the price of a hotel suite to a two-bedroom apartment in a popular neighborhood. Airbnb will almost always be cheaper. Airbnb also takes research. It's a skill, not unlike online dating, to determine what things will look like in real life, and more importantly, what's missing. 

If you want a safe trip with paint-by-numbers lodging, book a hotel. If you want less certainty but higher potential, book an Airbnb. It's that simple. But please stop complaining that something went wrong and Airbnb didn't immediately offer you an immediate solution. That's what hotels are for. ",275,2024-07-21 13:39:52,Illini2011,0.63

I don't get up myself. I'll wait for the signal to disembark, wait until the aisle clears and then take my luggage from overhead and leave.

Am I wrong?

Today I was in the aisle seat - we landed and I continued sitting. The guy next to me stood up, and then rudely asked me to get up as well and move into the aisle so he could stand up straighter (small budget airline). I refused - because it didn't make sense for me to also awkwardly stand in the aisle (which was already full of people standing) just because he didn't want to sit down and wait. I didn't ask him to stand. Nobody asked him to get up, and he had no luggage in the overhead!

1d23ndh,Azerbaijan Baku scams ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d23ndh/azerbaijan_baku_scams/,365,"Just got back from Azerbaijan and though the country is lovely I would never go back there again because of all the scams. I understand that every country has its fair share of scams but in Azerbaijan it felt like majority of them are out to get you for as little or as much as possible. 

The scams I faced are -
Scam 1 - As soon as I stepped out of the airport and booked a cab via Bolt taxi app which showed 6 Manat after discount , the driver tried to scam me by saying this is the starting price of the trip and full price will be displayed later and he showed me a third party app with a meter running on it . Realised it was a scam and asked him to drop me back at the airport (we just left the exit gate of airport at this point of time ) and then he started threatening me by asking to pay him the 6 Manat for parking fees. I asked him to drop me near the police car and will pay there . Fortunately, he just left me at the exit gate of airport and then left. Tried booking the taxi again via app and this time asked the driver before getting into the taxi if it‚Äôs the final price and he said no give  50 Manat and cancel the ride will take you the destination . Did not feel safe with this option so cancelled again . 
Used AirPort Express bus to get to the centre at last . 

Scam 2 - 
The hotel I booked for first night , the room had issues with the plumbing and he took me to an alternative hotel which was worst . Heard this is a common thing that happens as well. 

Scam 3 - 
Overcharged for food as a tourist . At a few places , when the locals were being charged around 4 Manat  the foreigners were being charged 8 Manat . Though this is a small amount and I don‚Äôt mind paying the extra it would be appreciated if asked and earned honestly . 

Scam 4 - 
Booked a tour to Gabala via a tour operator on Nizami St . The initial pick up time was 9 but the driver came at 11 , took us half way and said the car had some trouble and booked a bolt for us to drop back in the city . Didn‚Äôt complete the tour and did not give refund saying we went half way there and he spent money sending us back here again.

Scams that happened to other travellers 

Scam 5 - 
SIM card scam. The driver on the way from the airport will take you somewhere to buy a SIM card and they‚Äôll rip you off by charging over exorbitantly.

Scam 6 -
Many clubs will work with girls who‚Äôll take you to the clubs order expensive shit and you have to pay up or on Nizami st they‚Äôll invite you to check out their club once u sit at a table and order a drink , other girls will join you randomly and start ordering bottles and they‚Äôll ask you to pay it up.

There were no sickness packs in the front pockets.  As we hit some bad turbulence, my 6 year old daughter said she was feeling sick. I grabbed her and we ran towards the bathroom but we didnt make it and she threw up right outside of the bathroom by the door.  I didnt know what to do so I asked the flight attendant what I could do. He said ‚Äújust go sit down‚Äù. We went back to our seats and 10 minutes later a flight attendant came to me and asked ‚Äúcould you please come and clean it?‚Äù. I said no problem and went back where it had happened. They gave me a small pile of very thin paper towel (the ones you dry your hands with in the economy bathrooms) and that was it!

I had no problem cleaning after my own kid but would have loved some more supplies like maybe a dust pan kind of thing to not have to get fistfuls of vomit off the floor with thin napkins? Or maybe if they had sickness packs this could have all been avoided?

When we touched down, I downloaded it.

I clicked ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù and it made a form that was automatically sent to CPB and good for 4 hours. The whole process from downloading to completing it took around 4 minutes.

My phone was recovered quickly and the police did their job extremely well and efficiently . They were very kind, sweet and trying to cheer me up even though their english is obviously not fluent (my french is non existent so we had to communicate in simple english and google translate which made everything more wholesome). I am so grateful to team for putting in so much genuine effort and care into my situation, the whole ordeal took 5 hours (statements, investigations  etc) of their night time  just for my one shabby phone. Though I do have many important things on my phone and am still travelling for the next 3 weeks LMAO. Everyone including the officers at the station were just absolutely fantastic and nice I honestly cannot sing their praises enough. I wish I could give more details about what happened but I think it‚Äôs unsafe for the officers as their identities need to be protected if they work undercover.

I would also like to say that the people of Paris are absolutely wonderful from the bottom of my heart. The moment we realised that we were getting robbed and when the physical altercation happened to us, the Parisians gathered around us to protect us from them. There was this one french lady with a grey pixie cut that stayed with us immediately after the situation and alerted the nearby security guard who alerted the police nearby. I think without her help, her telling us what to do next, helping translate with the security guard and comforting us, the situation would have definitely not turned out so favourably. so thank you very much whoever you are I am so grateful to you too. 

In conclusion, despite the initial unfortunate incident there was a great display of cooperation and humanity seen by the parisian police and parisian people. Thank you very much from New Zealand.",44,2024-11-15 11:44:47,moelvirah,0.96

1e1ptyz,Update: solo travelling as a 21F Asian in Europe for the first time,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e1ptyz/update_solo_travelling_as_a_21f_asian_in_europe/,352,"I made a post last year on this topic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/s/NKiGjvZU09

Now that I'm back in Singapore after a life-changing 6 months of student exchange, I'd just like to share some of my thoughts and experiences (solo) travelling across Europe.

For someone who grew up in a sheltered environment in Singapore, Europe was surprisingly easy to adapt to after a few months. Granted, I was paranoid of almost anything at first and was constantly looking out for pickpockets, but I gradually grew more confidence as I did more (solo) travels. I did encounter racists and my dad was robbed in the Paris metro when he came over for holiday, but other than that these small incidents did not really damper my mood. I did face much more harrassment, weird cat-calling and other stuff done by weird creepy men than in my own country, but I learnt to take it in stride as long as no one is hurt at the end of the day. Not to say their behaviour was excusable of course, but I refuse to let such incidents bring my mood down and I do joke about it a bit to this day when sharing anecdotes from my exchange programme.
 
France was pretty dangerous compared to the rest of Europe, and of course I kept my wits about me. But it was still quite comfortable to travel around as a solo female (except in Marseille, god!). The language barrier was a concern at first, but the French people were really nice and helpful to me even with my subpar French, often speaking to me in perfect English or slowing down their speech so I understood them (except Parisians lol). I did multiple trips with friends to Spain (Barcelona and Basque country), around France, and a few other countries and they were all really fun! I loved having their company, but I found solo-travelling even more freeing.

I managed to do many solo travels to London, Italy, some cities in France, Poland, Hungary etc. I especially remember my 9 day solo trip to most of the major Italian cities very fondly as it was my first ""daring"" solo adventure in a country that was considered ""less safe"". I honestly felt safe in Italy even at 11pm or 12am at night as a female, which was way better than France. Not to mention the food and culture were absolutely amazing! My overly worried Asian relatives back home feared something would happen to me, but I came out of the whole thing basically unscathed.

I also went on a semi-solo trip to Poland, Slovakia and Hungary for 10 days and boy, I never felt safer in Poland and Slovakia, except a random racist encounter I had in Krakow that I simply brushed off. I felt really comfortable in those countries and everyone spoke really good English. Polish food is some of the most underrated, I would say, especially their pierogi. I'll be as bold as to say they are better than Chinese dumplings!

My point is that if you want to travel solo, go for it! Of course be careful and keep your wits about you, but if you are looking at European countries specifically, more often than not you will be relatively unscathed except for the increase in petty crime. The infrastructure is also well-developed here, comparable to Singapore, and services and people are generally transparent. I'm really happy I got to go on this once-in-a-lifetime experience!!

My travels for those interested, I went to:
1. France (Bordeaux, Lyon, Grenoble, Marseille, Paris, Lourdes, Avignon, Mont Saint Michel, Caen, Bayeux, Arcachon, St Emilion and Quimperle + Cornaceau + Pont Aven)
2. The Netherlands (Den Haag and Amsterdam and Zaanse Schans)
3. Belgium (Brussels)

13. Hungary (Budapest)

18tklwa,Egypt (March '23),https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18tklwa,354,"I have seen a lot of posts saying Egypt is the worst tourist destination and just wanted to provide an alternate view.

A girlfriend of mine and I (2 girls) went to Egypt for 2 weeks earlier this year. It was the most amazing trip. The destination is definitely not for beginner travelers and your trip can be made or broken by choosing the right tour guides.

First we spent a weekend in Alexandria on our own. It was amazing to be in the back streets and consume so much street food. Some of the best food I've had. Only weird experience (not unpleasant) was a bunch of kids on a field trip where we were. They were curious about us and asked us questions about where we're from, what languages we speak, if we were also Muslims. It was sweet, albeit a little surprising and overwhelming due to the number of kids (approx 30) surrounding us. But their chaperones led them away after a minute or so.

We got lucky with our tour guides in Cairo. We saw the Giza complex with a person who had managed the Giza complex for decades before he was forced to retire. His love of the complex kept him there and he chose to show people around as a tour guide. We went to the mummification chamber at 7:30 in the morning and had the entire complex virtually to ourselves for a good hour before people started arriving. We had a lovely girl accompany us to Saqqara. Not as empty but by no means crowded. 

Next we went on a cruise of the Nile from Abu Simbel to Luxor. Did not like being a part of a tour group. We were herded like sheep and some fellow tourists were harassed to buy stuff. I want to go back there and do all of this on my own, without a tour group. 

We headed to Hurghada on our own with a luxury bus (15‚Ç¨ p.P) it was quite relaxing. Had a bad experience with a cabbie (scammed us by saying we had handed him a smaller denomination note than we actually did. Got rather unpleasant). The rest was really nice. We stayed at a resort with a private beach which was quite cheap by European standards. We went out to a shopping mall to buy souvenirs and weren't bothered once by anybody. 

Flew on to Rome. 

I would really love to visit again. That is not to say that the trip didn't have its tough parts, but it was nowhere near as bad as it had seemed on Reddit. There was also quite a bit of luck involved and I can understand that this kind of a trip might not be desirable for everyone.

At this point it was 30 min after we were to depart. They pulled everyone who 'checked bags' at the door, off the plane and asked us again our seat number and a description of the bag. We told them and sat back down. 10 minutes later they come on the plane asking whose luggage was whose and holding peoples luggage in the air to figure out which seat they were in and therefor their final destination. They only held up mine and not my husband's, so we assumed they already had his taken care of (our second mistake for not verifying). They gave me one checked luggage tag with my husband's name on it. We never saw them physically put the tag on the luggage so we have no idea whose bag was tagged.

The plane departs late and arrives at CLT on time but due to short staffing, we wait on the tar mat for 40 min. We finally deplane 10 minutes before our connection departs. The whole time AA employees are promising us our bags will be at our final destination in Seattle.

We arrive in Seattle and shocker, luggage is not there. We then get an email that ONE of our bags was delayed and would be shipped directly to us in the morning. We are at baggage claim and the other luggage that is 'supposed to be on the plane' is not there. 

We go to AA baggage claim services at Seatac and explain the situation. They are confused why we don't have a second tag and we keep telling them they never gave us a second tag in Memphis. They keep asking which bag this tag belongs to and we keep telling them we have no idea because we never saw them put it on the bag and they handed me the tag with my husband's name on it.

So I guess the tagged bag is somewhere in Dallas now, delayed yet again and arriving at Seatac at 2am where they will call us at that time and tell us which bag it was. We still have no idea where the 2nd bag is and what is going on. We filled out a report at Seatac for this situation and in 5 days we were instructed to fill out the missing bag claim to get reimbursed for our belongings assuming the 2nd bag doesn't show up. We will also be filing a complaint for further compensation as this entire situation should have never happened in the first place.

I feel totally lost, there were sentimental items in those bags and our names are not on them as we were not aware we would be checking them until it was too late.

I am obviously venting, but I also need to know if I am missing anything on my end on what to do about this.

EDIT: we received the bag that was tagged, delivered to our house this morning. The final lady that helped us from AA made the world of difference in our attitude toward the company and flying as a whole, she was amazing.

Yes, I realize TARMAC was spelled incorrectly, that was helpful to point out. I should've known reddit would come down on me for that.

We are new travelers as my husband has a phobia of flying, through his stress and the trip in general, putting our names on bags never crossed our minds which shows how niave of travelers we are. This was a great learning opportunity in the end and we will obviously be taking more measures to be more prepared if there is a next time. 

Also, thank you to everyone who actually posted helpful comments and tips instead of criticizing our lack of traveling knowledge. ",160,2023-12-04 01:18:03,mcroly,0.74

There were no problems on the first part of the trip. While we were away, AA had their fiasco. 

We received an email three days ago stating my husband could not check in because of an ""altercation"" on our last flight over. This is not true. We always try to be easy passengers, especially so because an old friend of mine was a flight attendant and told us a lot of horror stories. Anyways, American called back to say there were no issues and we should be good to go. We went to check in just now and they told us the hold was still applied. 

We were lucky and got flights through Delta so I could get home somewhat on time and not lose my job. But do you have any advice on where to begin the process of figuring this out? As of right now, we are waiting for AA to call us back. Is there anything specific we could mention to make this a bit easier to navigate? We did see some police officers when we landed but we were not stopped and talked to or even looked at (aside from the normal ""thank you"" and ""thank you for flying""). Any advice would be so greatly appreciated! The financial cost of this mix-up is significant for us.

1etwudl,Beware of Fraud on Booking.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1etwudl/beware_of_fraud_on_bookingcom/,339,"I wanted to share a recent experience I had on Booking.com that I think everyone should be aware of. I‚Äôm a frequent traveler and a Level 3 client on the platform, and I recently encountered what seems to be a new type of scam that left me both shocked and frustrated.

Here‚Äôs what happened:

I booked a place in Los Angeles through Booking.com, expecting the usual reliable service. According to the listing, the check-in time was 4 PM. However, the host claimed they wouldn‚Äôt be available until 10 PM, which seemed suspicious. I immediately contacted Booking.com‚Äôs support, expressed my concerns, and was told that if the host didn‚Äôt respond within 30 minutes, the booking would be canceled. The host, though, only communicated with Booking.com, creating the appearance of a legitimate property while refusing to accommodate us. This seemed like a tactic to force us to cancel, which would result in a 100% loss of the booking fee.

After hours of waiting and escalating the issue with Booking.com‚Äôs management, they assured me that I could book another hotel, and they would cover the price difference and refund the original $2,200 payment. So, at around 1 AM, I booked another hotel nearby for $2,600. But here‚Äôs the kicker: Booking.com only refunded $100 from the original payment and later refused both the reimbursement and the full refund they had promised.

It appears that this scam involves hosts who create fake listings and manipulate communication with Booking.com to pressure travelers into canceling their bookings, allowing the host to pocket the payment without providing any service. I‚Äôm now considering legal action against Booking.com for failing to uphold their contractual obligations and leaving me out of pocket.

If you‚Äôre using Booking.com, please be extra cautious and scrutinize the listings, especially if they have very few or suspiciously perfect reviews. I don‚Äôt want anyone else to go through what I did.

Stay safe out there, and I‚Äôm happy to share more details if anyone has questions or similar experiences.",144,2024-08-16 13:54:17,KitchenDiscussion302,0.89

1gg9q07,Egypt...was actually pretty good?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gg9q07/egyptwas_actually_pretty_good/,334,"I finally went to Egypt, aware of that basically all of Reddit and YouTube calls it the worst place to visit as a tourist. I figured I had to go at least once in my life, just to see the Pyramids alone. 

I was very much prepared to be harassed and scammed throughout, so I kept my sunglasses on most of the trip, and auto-shot out ""la, shukran"" almost everywhere. However, overall I did not think the people were bad. Sure, the prices are inflated for tourists and yes, the local people try to get you to take pictures of them, get on their camels, and try to offer their services for everything and nothing. But I only said no once and that was it, each time. I never felt like I was in physical danger or uncomfortable. I honesty felt more at unease in Marrakech (I think because in the Medina's small alleyways, you literally have no place to go, if you are being bothered by someone). 

  
Overall, the only to negatives I experienced were:

\- Inflated prices for tourists. Prices are often not listed and the moment you come in as a foreigner, the price often goes up a lot. Meanwhile, any Arab could get it at the local price. I understand that it happens at restaurants that purely cater to tourists, but I generally felt that the inflation happened everywhere, from local shops, car rides, etc. Not the worst thing, as the country is still cheap, but it added a bit to the feeling of that you do just feel like a money pig at times.

\- It felt a bit like the wild west in terms of that there is no system. Everybody wants to be paid extra for something, but I feel like that also comes because the police  has all these random checkpoints where they harass drivers for money. One of my drivers told me this was a tourist tax, so it feels like something the police has decided to make up and enforce to profit of Egyptians. Who then in turn need to upcharge their fees. I also saw other checkpoints that did not seem police-enforced, but where drivers had to pay the locals. I also saw tour guides paying official personnel (at least, I think they were official?) at monuments. I feel like this is all under the guise ""please give me special treatment/don't harass the tourists."" Lots of monuments also had small quarters blocked off, but then a local would just jump over the rope and try to convince tourists to see this hidden corner for money. It was weird that this was a practice at some of Egypt's national treasures, that parts of monuments are blocked off just so scammers can use it to make money.

\- At times you do feel like an ATM machine for the locals. Some tours I went on were great. Some drivers invited me for a tea with them, others just gave directions without asking for anything back. But other times you'd go on a tour and you're just seen as cattle. ""Hurry up, hurry up!"" A tour I went on was cut short by over an hour and another tour rushed through everything. One time, after a long tour where we as a tourist group barely saw anything, the guides were just counting all the money they got today right in front of everyone, laughing and whispering in each other's ears. It was insult to injury.

  
That being said, I thought the sights were beautiful and overall, like I said, just shooting down people once allowed you to be done with them, very similar to other countries I have been to. I never felt in danger. Only difference I would have done, if I could do it again I would try and avoid any and all tour guides, as they're a mixed bag and a lot of them really are just out to make money. Egypt can definitely be done alone, as long as you organize some drivers between cities.",149,2024-10-31 03:31:46,DylanBVerhees,0.81

Being bumped from flights, charging extra just to sit together with family members, being literally locked in a plane for 90 minutes because ""you need two people to open the terminal door"" is just straight up wild.

1gmy9mk,Argentina‚Ä¶..WOW!,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gmy9mk/argentinawow/,312,"Spent two weeks in Argentina and can‚Äôt wait to go back and cover more. 

We spent 4 full days in BA, 5 in Mendoza area and 2 down in Bariloche. 

BA is an amazing city. It‚Äôs huge so plan days accordingly. We stayed in Palermo and found that area to be perfect to explore all the places we wanted. Great restaurants and shops there. 

Mendoza was focused on wine. Split time between Lujan de Cuyo area and Uco Valley. Had a private driver, which not only helped making sure we didn‚Äôt drink and drive, but he also was great at helping us understand the history of the areas. Smaller wineries beat the big ones for attention. And if I were to do it again, I‚Äôd maybe stay in Uco Valley because it was over an hour ride back to our lodgings at end of the day. 

Bariloche gave us the perfect taste of Patagonia but I want more. I want to go when it is summer and hike the area and do some horseback riding. 

Places we want to see on our next visit:  Cordoba, Salta, Mendoza (more wines!!), Bariloche, Ushuaia. 

Things that surprised us:

Argentine people are warm welcoming and super friendly. 

Argentina is no longer the cheap destination it was only a few years back. 

BA is filled with parks around every corner. And the flowers and vegetation is amazing. 

Credit cards are taken virtually everywhere. We were stressed about the whole bring dollars and exchange then there talk. Yes this is still a good practice but credit card companies are giving a very good exchange rate. Plus, when you exchange $200 US into $AR pesos, you‚Äôll walk away with freaking brick of currency. Not the safest feeling. 

Uber is cheap cheap cheap. But did find that if needing to get from one side of BA to the other during busier times of the day, the traditional cabs get to use the bus lanes and get thru traffic more quickly. 

We are going to go back. Maybe in next 3 years. Loved it!",161,2024-11-08 19:02:59,belgiqueatx,0.92
1gr0ydm,Barcelona &amp; Girona Trip Report,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gr0ydm,310,"My wife and I just returned from Spain. Our itinerary is basically like: 2 days in Barcelona, 4 days in Santa Susanna (for business purpose), and 1 night in Girona.

First, I will probably never buy Go City pass again. It‚Äôs effective for 2 days, NOT 48 hours. Because of this misunderstanding, the 2 of us ended up paying over 70 euros for the Barcelona BusTur√≠stic. And, from my understanding, Go City is a platform, and you will still need to book tickets for some of the tourist spots through various vendors. And even if you have booked the tickets, the vendors will cancel on you, which is the reason I wasn‚Äôt able to explore Park Guell.

Second part is transportation. From Santa Susanna to Girona, I took a Rodalies train headed to Figueres. The ticket machine didn‚Äôt work, so me and other tourists had to buy tickets from windows across the pathway, which was a bit annoying. And I was really surprised and confused because no one was checking our tickets and there wasn‚Äôt any kind of gates.

As a Chinese, I was surprised to find so many privately owned transportation companies. Public transportation in Barcelona was not cheap at all for us. Luckily we bought the T casual, which turned out to be very useful, and almost used all the 10 entrances. We were also grateful that our T casual ticket was applicable to the train to the airport. But I heard its price will rise in 2025 (?) Not good news.

We took a taxi once and a journey from mont juic to Sagrada Familia costs 18 euros. We also used Cabify once, and a 10 minute ride cost 10 euros. Pretty expensive, at least for us.

On our way back to Barcelona from Girona, we were lucky enough to get tickets from the window when the machines already stopped selling them. It took me a while to realize that AVANT belonged to Renfe and is a type of high speed train. I noticed that it ran at the speed of 200km/h. 

Thirdly, on where to go.

With Go City, we explored the Gothic Quarter and Sagrada Familia with 2 different guides. Both tours are bi-lingual, namely English and Spanish, so we had to wait when the guide was speaking Spanish. It seemed to me that the first guide spent much more time speaking Spanish, which is another reason I won‚Äôt buy Go City anymore - limited options! But of course if you can speak both languages, you can benefit a lot more from the tours. And the second guide was talking about how some angels on the fa√ßade were designed by a Japanese architect and because of that these angels have squinting eyes, blah blah, for quite a long time. Which I think is very racist.

Sagrada Familia and Casa de Batllo were definitely highlights of this trip. I had high hopes but still was shocked by how beautiful they were. Btw, I really liked the handhold phone-like audio guide with number buttons. One simply needs to tap the numbers and listen. I used this type of guides in Basilica de San Felix in Girona as well and found it really handy. Apart from its grandeur, Sagrada Familia‚Äôs construction timeline was also very interesting-next to it we saw a building with a banner that reads ‚Äúour houses are legal‚Äù.

Girona is a lovely place for hiking and eating. We especially enjoyed walking in the old city and on the ancient wall when there were warm sunlights. But we did not enjoyed the urine and feces on the wall. We bought a combination ticket for Basilica de San Felix, Girona Cathedral and Girona Art museum, which were awe-inspiring architectural creations. 

At last, some random thoughts.

There was a guy on our train back to the airport who was leaving packed tissue paper on empty seats next to passengers. And after some time he came back to collect these paper. I wonder how much he is gonna charge if someone took one pack.

Btw, you should be mindful of the ground in Barcelona, because there was feces in an elevator leading to the Left Luggages in Sants Estacio -we were really grateful that we saw it. 

We tried 2 raw oysters and sea urchin in Boqueria Mercat. Should I be worried that parasites get into my brain?",28,2024-11-14 03:17:32,RodionInChina,0.94
1ggfqxp,Detained at Border Control (UK/EU/US),https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ggfqxp/detained_at_border_control_ukeuus/,297,"Wife and I recently returned from our European Honeymoon- the first time I had ever been abroad and more than likely the last.

Our plan was a 2 week trip split between England, France, and the Netherlands. After a 10 hour flight from the East Coast (US) I was stopped and detained by UK Boarder Police. I was put in a room for several hours given no indication of ""why"" I had been detained, If i would be denied entry, or at the very least given a chance to the American Embassy (they took my phone and all my documents) A supervisor came in and asked me very leading and accusatory questions (Why are you here? Do you live in Europe? Have you ever been arrested?) Again for context, I am an American Citizen with no criminal record and never traveled out of the country. After I was questioned, another hour went by, then the same supervisor, who seemed intent on catching me up in some sort of lie, smiled at me, handed me back my papers and welcomed me to the UK. Odd to say the least.

  
We took a train to France and The Netherlands, no hiccups. But when I was going through passport control again in Amsterdam, The Dutch Boarder Control also detained me. Again, no explanation given or time to sit with my wife. I was again released after only an hour or so.

When returning to the U.S, I was relieved to be back home, and felt a relative safety in showing the Customs agent my American Passport. This time, with the most aggressive and accusatory language thus far, I was again detained by my own country. I want to reiterate, every time I was detained, I politely asked several times who they thought I was, what watchlist my name was on, ect. The only explaination I got from the US people was ""You've got a very common name."" There are less than 200 people in the world with my surname, probably only a handful, if not one or two, with my first name. 



My question to the subreddit is to see if there is a database somewhere online where I can search for People of Interest to Europe (Maybe not just the EU, because I was detained in England and the US as well) and if there's any steps I can take to make sure this doesn't happen again if I decide to travel abroad again.

1gkike3,"If traveling to the Philippines, avoid Philippine Airlines if you can. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gkike3/if_traveling_to_the_philippines_avoid_philippine/,240,"Philippine Airlines (PAL) is the only airline that flys from the LAX directly to Manila. If flying from LAX, flight time to Manila is 14 hours on average. Other airlines have connections and travel time are 18 hours or more. However, direct is always not best, especially if you are flying Philippine Airlines. They are just the absolute worst. And my experience is not a one-off. This has been a recurring issue for decades that can't be addressed because, well, they are the flag-carrier of the Philippines and there's no competition.  
  
Our family of three booked a flight to Manila from LAX via Philippine Airlines, with paid and reserved seats on both legs. Flight to Manila was smooth, from the booking, check-in process until we left the airport. I was surprised because for years of flying LAX-MNL and back, I have always encountered an issue with Philippine Airlines. Issues ranging from defective seats, entertainment console, tray tables, lost baggages (with valuables, and only the baggage with the valuables gets lost every single time) etc. But this time, it was smooth. I was surprised.  
  
But PAL soon enough showed its true colors. A few days before our return flight, I got an email saying that the aircraft got downgraded from a Boeing to a smaller Airbus. As a result, they are now overbooked and looking for volunteers to be put on a different flight. Because of this, our family lost paid seats. After calling customer service, I also found out that my wife and toddler got put on a different flight and on a different day. They got put on that flight without our approval. Without any consent. 

To put them on the same flight as myself, we had to buy new seats. On top of what we already paid for previously. Ok, what's another $300 on top of our $3000 ticket right?

The night before our flight, I couldn't check-in my wife and toddler. App and website show they are waitlisted and we had to settle the issue on the counter.

Day of the flight, we arrived 4 hours early to check-in. In their system, my wife and toddler does not have a seat. The payment that we made is not reflecting in their system. They were actually in the process of putting my wife and toddler to another flight which is 3 days later. I fought it. I showed the receipt including the credit card transaction of our paid seats. Agent went inside the office and had to ask the manager to override the system. Great, we got in the flight together. We were able to go home.

But imagine if you're an elderly that does not have access to all these tools. Imagine if you are not tech-savy, or it's your first time traveling. Imagine if it's a one-way trip and all your funds are on this flight with no other means. 

As I mentioned, this is not the first time that this happened to me. When I was single and younger, I was traveling to/from LAX-MNL and this happens quite often. I always pay and reserve a window seat but most of the time I get re-assigned and placed in the middle of the middle aisle. I've submitted complaints. I've filed grievances. All I get every time is a ""We are sorry for your unpleasant experience."".",58,2024-11-05 15:58:29,Nassstyyyyyy,0.9

First of all, I was TERRIFIED before my India trip. I kept reading of all these horrible stories and bad experiences. I‚Äôve always had an interest in hinduism, yoga, and I LOVE indian food so India was on the top of my list. So this year In September I finally gave it a go and booked a Gadventures tour. I chose to do the classic Golden Triangle tour because its only a week and I wanted to test the waters on whether I would like India or not.

I LOVED IT. The food was amazing, the activites we did were very cool, and I met so many great people on the tour. I normally do not book tours as I think visiting a country on your own brings a more authentic experience. However, I did not want to do any planning for India and felt more safer in a group. 

Not once did I feel unsafe, not once did i get sick. So for those of you hesitating on India, I say GO FOR IT. But I highly recommend booking a tour. There were many solo travellers in our group and the ages ranged from 23-65. I can only speak for Gadventures but im sure there are many other great tours as well. 

There are so many other places in India that I want to see and I am now a lot less scared to do so. If anyone has any questions dont hesitate to ask!

1gesits,Vietnam eVisa rejected 5 times,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gesits/vietnam_evisa_rejected_5_times/,220,"Hi everyone, first-time poster. Currently in a dire dilemma and this is also a half rant.
I've got a trip planned to Vietnam in two weeks, and I applied for the visa a month in advance. It's now been rejected five times very with an error alluding to an incomplete contact address and permanent residence address, which I‚Äôve duly filled out - the same way my partner who‚Äôs a Dutch passport holder did and received their approval after 3 days.

Of course, I wondered if it's a technical problem and decided to contact some of the agencies previously mentioned on this sub. 


The big problem is that I'm a Nigerian passport holder living abroad, and i've already been turned down by two Asian countries (Taiwan told me I cannot apply for a tourist visa; Thailand requires a certificate that proves that i've never been convicted for drug-related charges and must be legalised by the Thai embassy in Nigeria, where I haven't lived in for a long time now). 

Every agency i've reached out to for a Vietnam visa either stopped replying as soon as I mentioned that I've got a Nigerian passport, or told me that they can't help me. I don't know what else to do as my trip is in two weeks (luckily, my trip starts in Hong Kong and I got a visa after a rigorous 2 month process). 

I feel so down-trodden and lost. Already changed my tickets twice for more money after i found out that Taiwan and Thailand were impossible. I'm willing to give this one last try with ANY agency that's willing to help me out with the visa process.

I know that our reputation as Nigerians precedes us but some of us really want to experience the world too.


EDIT: Found an agent through the comments who was willing to help! Shared enough proof that I live abroad, have enough income and my ticket to Vietnam from Hong Kong and out and they will be working with me.

We were in Cassis around 8pm, weather was meh and streets and patio were all totally empty, not a living soul around. There was this restaurant opened by the yatch club and we decided to go and sit at a table on the patio. We were totally alone. Alone at the restaurant and alone on the streets, like it was a ghost town. 

The oh so friendly and charming waiter was so kind and heard our Qu√©bec accent and started to chat with us about how it is to live in Marseille, asking us how it is to live in Montreal. And then it starts pouring rain something crazy and all the staff came running at us with bunch of sunshades to make sure we don't get any rain. 

Then they brought us oysters and amazing seafood pasta. When we finished and were ordering some night caps, the waiter came sitting with us and we talked for an hour while he was drinking with us under that pouring rain. 

When we left all the staff came to say good bye and we did not pay for 2 of our drinks.

1gdg9r5,"Flew Lufthansa for the first time (multiple flights), will try to avoid them in the future. Here are my impressions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gdg9r5/flew_lufthansa_for_the_first_time_multiple/,185,"What a trashfire of an airline Lufthansa is!

I've flown a lot over the years - since I started keeping track, I have 420 flight segments listed, but there were plenty more before that.  The majority of my flights have been on US and European airlines, but I've also flown on some others.  Until a couple of months ago, I had never flown Lufthansa.

I don't fly super low cost carriers like Wiz and Ryanair, and I expected Lufthansa to be a solid, normal airline like the ones I'm used to.  It wasn't.

My trip was a two week open jaw, with two segments on each flight day, so six segments total, on three different weekends, going to/from four different countries.  All six segments were Lufthansa-operated, not codeshares on some other carrier.  Because of that, I think I got a good general sense of what Lufthansa is like, not a fluke.  What it's like is not at all what I want to deal with in the future.

Now, the flights themselves did go pretty much as scheduled, I got where I was going, and so did the bags (though with a very long wait a couple of times).  That's what I normally expect and what normally happens with other airlines.  Frankfurt airport, where I had to transfer twice, is pretty awful - huge, poorly signed, hard to get around.  Lufthansa's planes on both occasions were located far from the terminal, requiring a bus ride of more than ten minutes _after_ you ""board"" past the gate (yes, I timed it the second time, out of curiosity).  The other time I transferred through Munich, which was more of a normal airport experience.

So there's the best I can say about Lufthansa - they did fly me to where I was supposed to go, and got my bags there.  And I expect they do the necessary maintenance to keep their planes safe, and in working condition.

On the interior, though, their planes seem like they were made many decades ago and not really maintained, let alone upgraded.

* On two of the six segments I flew, the seatback pocket in front of me had come undone on the bottom, so anything you placed in it could just fall through to the floor.

* _None_ of the six planes I flew on had power outlets or USB charge ports, even the transatlantic flights, although a couple of them had what seem to be decoy USB ports - you could plug a USB into them, but no power.  Yes, I tried multiple USB cords to make sure.

* They didn't offer movies and other entertainment on in-flight wifi, instead they had those tiny screens on the back of the seat in front of you like planes used to have 20 years ago.

* Although I rarely need to go to the bathroom in the middle of a flight, I did on one of these Lufthansa flights, and found that of the 4 lavatories in our main cabin section, two had no water and were therefore effectively out of use (with hand-written paper signs taped to the doors to let you know), which means I had to wait in line for a while even though it was the middle of the flight and few people were using them.  Maybe this was a fluke and their lavatories are kept in good repair on all their other planes, but somehow I doubt that.

Overall, it just feels like they've let these planes deteriorate for decades, putting in minimal effort to maybe fix some of the most egregious problems, and just aren't upgrading them.  All six different planes I was on, on three different weekends, going to or from different countries, which makes me pretty confident that this is the general sad state of their fleet.

But where Lufthansa really shines is what comes before the flight - web site, booking, seat selection, checkin, and so on.  They not only were the worst at all of this of ANY airline I've ever flown, but they were so far worse that they're in a whole different category, where no other airline comes anywhere close.  Let me list the ways, minor and major:

* Their web site is impressively slow, which makes a lot of their other problems more frustrating, especially since they require you to do a lot of things on their web site as separate operations that you'd normally not have to do with other airlines.

* If you make a booking when not logged in to your account, you _cannot_ add it to your account even if it's under your name.  You have to look it up by name and locator (code) every single time.  Most other airline web sites let you ""import"" a booking if yours by entering the locator once, and then it shows up in your account.

* When you book and by tickets, you get an email sent to you with the itinerary ... but no hint of what you paid!

* Getting this ""receipt"" - a record of what you paid - is an adventure.  Reservations customer service cannot get their system to email you a ""receipt"", they say the only way to do it is by requesting a receipt on the web site.  To request a receipt on the web site, you have to enter the ""document number"", which is NOT your reservation locator (that 6 number/letter code).  For your flight reservation itself, the document number is the ticket number, which is on the ticket, but you can't view your ticket when logged in on the web site.  Even worse, though, is that paid seat selection and paid checked baggage are totally separate items with their own separate document numbers and separate receipts.  You cannot get a single itemization of what you paid for all of it.

* You can't add passport information to your account, to have it automatically added for all your flights.  You have to enter all of your passport information for each online check-in.  I also tried calling reservations customer service to see if they could add my passport information, and they said no I need to do it online.  Okay, how do I do it online, I asked - I can't find it on the web site?  Turns out they can't help with the web site, for that I have to call their ""web support"", but web support is only open during working hours on weekdays.  And it turns out they were giving me false information anyway - as I noted earlier, you actually can't do it on their web site, their reservations people just don't seem to know that.

* Speaking of online check-in, what a mess!  First of all, each check-in requires filling out a lot of information (such as your passport details) on forms that span multiple pages.  Given that it can take 30+ seconds for a single page to load, that's bad enough.  It's even worse when you're traveling and using bad hotel wifi or a roaming cell hotspot, and it can take many minutes for a page to load.  If you've gotten to the 6th page of the check-in and it fails there, you have to go back to the beginning to try again.

* Their system made me check in separately for each segment of a flight, even if I was flying A to B to C on the same day on the same reservation.

* Check in failed at the end of the process multiple times, with a message saying ""Something went wrong. We are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later.""  This happened to me on, I think, three different check-ins.  When it gives that message, there's a button to cancel check-in, but no other options.  I found out eventually that if you don't click that button, you are actually checked in.

* ... but when you are actually checked-in, the invitation to check in for the flight still appears when you are logged in and looking at the main page.  If you click that link, then it gives you an error, and that error is because you've already checked in.

* Oh, and you can't copy and paste must of the passenger information, for either booking or check-in, because they use auto-collapsing boxes that only show up when you mouse over them and seem to prevent pasting.

* They have a web chat that's supposedly there to help with web issues, but every time I tried it it, when I actually typed in a question, the response was always ""I'm sorry, a technical error occurred. Please try again.""  Every time.

* Also it kept telling me I needed to enter passenger contact information, even though all the passenger contact information was there.  Whenever I would confirm that the information was correct, it would tell me it was incomplete, and the red message to fill in passenger contact information never went away.

But the worse part was seats.  Because I was flying an open jaw and my partner was just doing a round trip, we were going to share the same three segments at first, and then my remaining segments were on my own.  So I made separate reservations for us, and paid to select seats, to seat us together.

THEY KEPT CANCELLING OUR SEATS.

Seriously, this happened for every single flight, for both of us.  Sometimes several times for the same flight.  On one flight, our seats were cancelled FOUR times, in the four weeks between when I booked and when we flew.  Each time, I had to go back through their web sites slow loading and counterintuitive UI to re-select our seats, and sometimes pay the difference if they were more expensive.

Sometimes, they moved us to different seats, so we still had seats, but not where we'd selected.  A couple of times we ended up together in the new seats, but the other times, they put us in different parts of the plane.  Other times, one or the other of us lost seat assignment altogether, and didn't have any seat selected at all.  One of those times, when I selected a new seat that cost the same as the original one, I had to pay again for it, because the credit didn't transfer.  I was able to get the credit to transfer only by calling customer service; they were able to look and see that I had already paid the same amount for a seat and then lost it, so I shouldn't have to pay again this time.  But they kept doing this over and over and over, so it meant I had to start checking their web site every few days just to make sure we hadn't lost our seats again, or to grab them back quickly in case they had, before someone else got them.

I know sometimes airlines have to move your paid seat if they have to change aircraft and the new aircraft has a different seat arrangement, but that's very rare.  I've had it happen maybe 1 out of 100 flights on other airlines.  Here it happened over 10 times (for two people, so over 20 seats de-assigned or moved) for just this one trip, including 4 times for a single flight segment ... and nearly every time, the same seats we'd lost were still available so I could re-select them, and the seatmap looked completely identical.

When I griped about this to the group we were with at our first destination, a couple who were also flying Lufthansa checked their seats for their return flights and told us the same had happened to them, and they needed to re-select their seats.

Oh, and to add a little bonus to all of this, for our return flight where I had to fix the seats the day before we flew, the we portal then showed the wrong seats - not the ones I'd just re-selected.  I thought we were seated apart again, and called customer service, who refused to help (even though we'd paid for the seats together).  I figured I'd try to fix it at the airport desk, but then it turned out we actually did get the seats I paid for and the web site was just lying.",94,2024-10-27 12:28:08,cos,0.71

Luckily, the community here was able to remind me of how privileged I am, and to grant me some perspective.

Also, if these videos ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù one person to travel more, or inspire someone to want to travel one day, then they‚Äôre a good influencer in my book.

Enjoy your travels, everyone!

1g83r02,Thailand negative review trouble,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g83r02/thailand_negative_review_trouble/,156,"So I am on holiday in Thailand and went to a boxing event. Left a 3 star review because I had been to better organized matches and the selection of snacks wasn't my favourite. Also no live music for the fights. 

All in all, not a bad review, can be seen as constructive criticism. 

Half way through a match, an employee of the owner pulls me from the ranks and asks me to speak to the owner. The owner then made it very (and aggressively clear, that my review needs to be deleted asap). I did so. 

He then called the police on me and said he will file a report. He tried to get my passport info and my real name, hotel and room number from me. I didn't hand that out, afraid he would seek me out and beat me up or something. 


Now I read that it's actually a CRIME to leave bad reviews in Thailand (has something to do with defamation) be it a true review or not, you can end up in jail and people have been fined thousands of dollars. 

I don't want to pay up or end in jail. What is a realistic punishment? Am I screwed, and if so, how bad? 

I can only find the big public cases but nothing about tourists being fined for ""petty"" reviews like mine.

1g7by16,Trip report - Argentina Oct '24,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g7by16/trip_report_argentina_oct_24/,141,"I just came back from Argentina and thought it would be useful to do a report of the situation over there and what I did.
 
Flew from London and stayed for 2 weeks. Flights with BA premium economy where ¬£800 x 2 people. Booked a year in advance with Amex Avios. Given it was a 16 hour journey, the extra space was 10/10.

Hotels - spent a total of ¬£1.2k. Booked online through booking.com and then paid once I was there. All hotels gave me the option to pay with my credit card or with pesos argentinos. You can go cheaper, you can go more expensive. We stayed in nice hotels in very central locations.

Internal flights: ¬£960

Transport - we used taxis everywhere. It was just cheap and convenient. Rides were anywhere between ¬£5 to ¬£9. There's Uber/Cabify in BA and we just used normal taxis everywhere else. There's an underground and buses but I just didn't really look into it. Don't take a normal taxi at the airport. One taxi was charging me $45 but Uber was less than half that. If using Uber/Cabify you can pay with card, otherwise you will need cash.

Money - probably the most complicated part of Argentina. At the moment of travelling, Visa is offering a very similar rate to the ""blue dollar"" with ¬£1 = $1300-1400 pesos. My bank doesn't charge any foreign fees so that was perfect.

You can make your money go further if you bring $100 notes and then exchange them in BA. The thing is that there are a lot of ""cambios"" and you need to make sure you go to one that 1) has a good exchange rate 2) doesn't scam you. We asked our hotels for recommendations.

The notes have to be in perfect condition. Do not bring notes of other denominations. We had $1.2k in USD and had left $150. We actually didn't need as much. Most places take credit card and it was just easier to pay by card. Tips are only in cash and the standard is 10%. 

Food - you can eat as cheap as ¬£5 or go to ¬£80 for an amazing dinner at a steakhouse. I'd say, the food everywhere was delicious. There's a lot of specialty coffees in BA and this was great for breakfast (and I think I will just forever miss medialunas from now on)

English - not as widely spoken as I thought but people will make an effort. I speak Spanish so for me it wasn't an issue but just something to be mindful of. A little bit of Spanish will go a long way. My husband doesn't speak Spanish but he tries and people just immediately has a completely different reaction to him trying.

Buenos Aires - 8 days
Looking back, I would recommend spending less time in Buenos Aires and more in other places. Not because BA wasn't awesome (it was) but the nature in Argentina is just strikingly beautiful and when we were planning our trip we were worried we were trying to do too much.

We did all the ""touristy"" stuff on our own here. Just took taxis to wherever we wanted. 

Stayed in Palermo Soho, which was our favourite area for sure. Lots of restaurants, cafes, bar and you can walk everywhere. It also felt like the ""safest"" area, being able to walk at night without much thought.

My highlights of BA were:
- Going to a Boca Juniors game. A friend helped me with this. There are tours, which I would recommend if you don't speak Spanish as the area is a bit sketchy at night.
- Puerto Madero bar crawl at sunset
- Palermo bar crawl
- San Telmo Market on Sunday
- Recoleta Cemetery (do a tour! Otherwise you will miss out on the history)

Iguaz√∫ - 2 days 
We had 1 day to explore so only did the Argentinian side. Honestly, one of the most incredible things I have seen in my life. We spent 6 hours walking through the whole park. The park is very well organised and it's just so so beautiful.

Bought the tickets for the park online but you can also buy them on the day. If you go 2 days in a row you get 50% on the second day and then can do the Brazilian side (which we couldn't do)

Make sure you take with you: mosquito repellent, suncream, waterproof jacket, clothes that dry quickly, comfortable shoes and food and drinks for your day. You will get wet once you are very close to the waterfalls.

The town is small but has a lot of bars and restaurants. Super safe town, perfect to go out at night after a whole day walking. 

Calafate - 3 days
We booked a full day tour to Perito Moreno which included transport to and from the park, plus the mini trekking on the actual glacier.

You could do the park on your own. The park has a series of boardwalks. If you want to walk all the trails you will need approx 3-4 hours. With the tour we only had 2 hours and a half but felt like that was more than enough.

Then, the mini trekking starts. This was 100000/10. Our guide was brilliant, we learnt so much and time wise, it was enough. I had never walked with crampons so it took some time to get used to. You definitely need to be relatively fit and your knees have to work fine. Going up or down ice is a bit intense.

Hielo y Aventura is the only company that can take you to do the mini trekking but once you are in town, you will find lots of companies offering the same. They are all kind of like travel agents and arrange everything with you.

Take with you: waterproof comfortable shoes (you don't want ice cold water in your feet), suncream, sunglasses, windproof jacket, gloves and food and drinks.

Second day - we did a boat tour which takes you through Lago Argentino to aee other glaciers, like Upasala and Spegazzini. You get really close and it's really impressive. I would say this was worth it. You are pretty much chilling on a boat all day looking at the landscape.

Take with you: food &amp; drinks (they are very expensive otherwise), windproof jacket, sunglasses.

Calafate town is small but once again, has lots of bars and restaurants. My favourite parilla (steakhouse) was Rustico. I'm sad I can't have more of that lamb. For your excursions, you can go into any bakery and buy sandwiches and pastries to take with you. 

We stayed 3 days here as we used 1 extra day just for chilling but probably not needed.

Argentina was really incredible. The history of the country is complicated and interesting. The people were just so nice and helpful. The nature is something I had never seen before and some landscapes are so vast...looking at kilometres and kilometres of glaciers was something I can't describe.

Don't let ""negative"" things put you off. Like in many places around the world, you just have to be street smart: don't have your phone out on a table or walk mindlessly.

Anyway, I hope I can be back to explore more of this beautiful country.

Long story short, my stay in China was over and I had to leave the country. So, I chose Cambodia as my next destination. I applied for the e-visa and it got approved in one day. Shortly after that, I booked my tickets with China Southern Airlines, and went to the airport the next day.

Upon checking in at the airlines‚Äô counter, they asked me for all the necessary documents, which I all had. After a while, they told me that I can‚Äôt fly to Cambodia because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to. I was confused because I even had a visa and all the necessary bookings. I asked for the reason, and they said that they called the immigration in Cambodia and they told them not to allow me board the plane. I protested for some time and tried to make sense of the situation but the airlines just kept denying. As the flight time was approaching, I gave up and went back to the hotel.

I kept thinking of what might be the problem but I just couldn‚Äôt figure out anything that could possibly make sense. I even called the Cambodian embassy to ask for clarification and this is exactly what they told me:  ‚ÄúWe gave you the visa, that means you have all the rights to fly to our country‚Äù

After I exhausted my efforts with the airlines, I booked a new flight with another airlines (Cathay Pacific). I went to the airport on the flight day. Was so nervous at that time. Luckily, everything went well and nobody denied me. I landed in Cambodia with zero issues.

My question is, what do you guys think might be the reason for being denied by China Southern Airlines?",52,2024-10-30 07:11:36,Goonermax,0.81

1gee3z5,My trip to Beijing: my experience and my tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gee3z5/my_trip_to_beijing_my_experience_and_my_tips/,72,"Hello everyone,  
before leaving for this trip, I looked up tons of information that ended up being useful, yet I still had a few doubts. I'll try to summarize my experience to help clarify some of the harder-to-find details online and make a mini-guide.

**Disclaimer:**

* This text will be translated from another language, and I don‚Äôt have the skills to write it entirely in English without errors (I hope it turns out readable).
* This isn‚Äôt meant to be a professional guide‚ÄîI only hope it helps someone.
* If there are any mistakes in my advice, please let me know. It will also be useful for me in case I return.
* If you have better tips than mine, I hope you share them for the reasons above‚Äîit will help everyone who reads this.
* I read a very detailed guide on Reddit (I didn‚Äôt save the username) which was very helpful, and I hope I‚Äôm not repeating too much of it here. If I find the post, I‚Äôll write it in the comments.

# Tips before the trip:

1. **Internet is essential.** Buy a SIM card with roaming that works outside China. I bought Holafly and had no problems. This SIM seemed to connect through roaming from HK, so Google and Meta apps worked without any blocks. I simply activated it on the plane before takeoff, and I didn‚Äôt need to install a VPN. Honestly, the internet wasn‚Äôt very fast with this provider, but I never had issues.
2. **Install the following apps:**
   * **WeChat**: Helpful for its mini-apps like Dianping (similar to Tripadvisor) and for booking a visit to Tiananmen Square.
   * **Alipay**: The app I used the most; essential for booking taxis through DiDi and paying via QR codes (everything is on the homepage, and you can add your credit card by following the registration steps).
   * **Maps.me**: Useful for navigating metro stops.
   * **Translator app**: Any that works offline (download the language pack before the trip). I advise against Samsung‚Äôs Interpreter, as it often gave inaccurate results, though it did provide some laughs.
   * **Tip**: It‚Äôs useful to have a way to translate app texts directly on your phone to save time with non-English apps.
3. **Cash?** I never needed to pay in cash, so I didn‚Äôt withdraw any. I only exchanged 50 euros initially, which I used at a restaurant to avoid returning with unused cash.

# Useful things to know:

* **Public restrooms** in Beijing are EVERYWHERE, but they may differ from what we‚Äôre used to in the West. They‚Äôre almost all squat toilets, which might be challenging for some women. There‚Äôs always a cleaning staff nearby, but keeping them perfectly clean at all times seems challenging, and they‚Äôre not always spotless.
* **Queues**: You may encounter queues, but they‚Äôre incredibly quick, whether for attractions or security checks.
* **Security**: It‚Äôs emphasized heavily, but the police are very cordial and willing to help. They always kindly assisted us when we asked for information.
* **Transportation**:
   * **Taxis** (via the DiDi app) were very affordable (around 2-3 euros per ride), so I used them more than the metro.
   * **Metro**: I used it during rush hours and when traffic was heavy (it costs next to nothing). It‚Äôs very intuitive to use. Select your stop on the screen, and it generates an access card for the ride. I think you can also use a Visa/Mastercard to access and then exit at your destination without a ticket, but I‚Äôm not sure.
* **Interactions**: Certain people, especially teens, might ask for a photo if you‚Äôre blonde or have a very Western appearance‚Äîit‚Äôs quite fun.
* **Prices**: In general, things seemed very affordable unless they were imported, which makes sense.
* **Safety**: I‚Äôve never felt as safe walking around a city as I did here. The level of security seems extremely high.

# Attractions:

1. **Booking tickets**: I didn‚Äôt book any attractions in advance; I simply bought tickets on-site and never had trouble except for Tiananmen Square.
2. **Must-see areas**:
   * **Shichahai**
   * **Nanluogu Xiang**
   * **Wangfujing Street**
3. **Bar recommendation**: El Nino (located in a Hutong).
4. **For a view of the CCTV building**: Go to Migas Mercado (a Spanish restaurant) in China World Mall for a fantastic evening.
5. **Mutianyu Great Wall**: I booked a guide online for the visit. While time was limited, it was a nice experience. Keep in mind that the guide will tell you to descend at a certain time. I chose this option because I read there‚Äôs a risk of not finding taxis for the return trip since the Wall is quite far.
6. **Tiananmen Square**: There are strict security checks, and you need to book a ticket through a mini-app on WeChat. I didn‚Äôt do it in time as I discovered it too late. I read that after entering the Forbidden City, you can access the square through an entrance that isn‚Äôt otherwise allowed, but I didn‚Äôt try it, so I can‚Äôt confirm. I did pass by it in a taxi at night.
7. **Other attractions I visited**:
   * Temple of Heaven
   * Lama Temple
   * Summer Palace

Overall, it was a beautiful trip, and although I wish I had more time, I can say I managed to see a lot. I recommend this city and hope to return to China as soon as possible. I hope these tips are helpful and that everything I wrote is clear. If I remember anything else, I‚Äôll add it as an update. Safe travels, everyone!",20,2024-10-28 16:44:42,Mandibolus,0.87
1gialcp,Would you spend a month in Oslo? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gialcp/would_you_spend_a_month_in_oslo/,77,"My favorite way to travel is to rent an Airbnb for a month in the summer (which is the only time of year that my family can get away for that long).

We were thinking about going to Oslo this summer, but everyone seems so down on Oslo! I would love your thoughts if you have been there, or if you have any other recommendations. 

Our only criteria is that we prefer to be in a large-ish city, and we'd like it to be cold in July (like in the 60s Fahrenheit). We stayed in Edinburgh for a month, and it was perfect. We also loved Montreal (which was warmer, but we had air-conditioning). I would love to hear any suggestions of cities that you love that are cold!

It's far too small as it hasn't been renovated since the Vietnam war so it can't handle the passenger traffic it gets. 

Lines are insanely long and it's the only one I've ever been to that puts natives and foreigners in the same immigration lines, taking at least 2 minutes to process each person on their ancient Packard Bell computers regardless of their nationality (what they're ""processing"" for 2 minutes with the locals is beyond me). There are E-gates than never work, even for locals so you end up standing with pushy rude locals who don't know how to queue. 
I arrived at 1am and it was still a solid hour of waiting for immigration. Customs are also crazy busy. The staff don't speak a word of English so just rudely bark orders at you in Vietnamese. This is for both arrivals and departures.

It's also insanely hot inside because despite being in the tropics, they're stingy with AC so you end up sweating while waiting in departures. And there's hardly any facilities inside so you're best off eating before you go and bring entertainment with you.

Here is a resume of my recent 12days in Myanmar.

Stay: October 2024

The journey:

Arrived in Yangon airport from Bangkok.

For making money exchange, only 2 offices are open and the rate is around 3860 Kyats for 1‚Ç¨. But at this moment, looking around if there is other options to change money, one policeman called me and propose me to do foreign exchange at a better rate (1‚Ç¨=4000 Kyats). I accepted his offer but only change the minimum to take a taxi and eat. So i changed 20‚Ç¨.

To reach Chinatown from the airport, i took a taxi for 20 000 Kyats. I used Grab apps to negotiate.

In chinatown (Yangon) i bought a sim card + 2.5 GB data for 8000 Kyats, directly in the street. Was a little bit complicated because you need to buy an empty sim card alone (5000 Kyats) and buy a recharge ticket (3000 kyats). For recharging, you need to tape some code, so i asked to the sim vendor to do it for me. 

I did a second euros exchange with my hotel at the following ratio (1‚Ç¨= 4500 Kyats). I changed 100‚Ç¨ at this time.

I did all my visits in Yangon in 3 full days. At this moment Shwedagon Pagoda ticket was 20 000 Kyats.

I did a last money exchange in Yangon on the 34 street at a shop named ""wave money"". Ratio was the best i had during all my stay in Myanmar (1‚Ç¨= 4900 Kyats)

After Yangon i moved to Bago for 2 days.
I used the public transportation (Bus n¬∞116 from Sule bus stop) to ""htauk kyant"" (500 Kyats) and then a minivan (that comes regularly to bring people of Yangon to Bago) for 3000 kyats/ 1 people + 3000 Kyats/ bagage seat (my big bag needed his own seat because he is so big). Total duration of the trip was 4 hours.

After Bago, i moved to Bagan with a night bus from Yangon  (Aungmingalar station - 1h from the city center). You can buy a ticket directly on the office of a company but if you want to book in advance (which i did), i asked to my hotel to do it for me because foreigner Credit cards doesn't work here. I used the website mmbusticket.com to book.

Arrived in Bagan i stayed in Nyang-U village at  Shwe Na Di guest house for 45 000 Kyats per night. And was actually the cheaper one that i found.

My last destination was finally Mandalay, i reach this city with a private bus that my Hotel guest in Bagan booked for me.

In Mandalay city i had to make a currency exchange and it was a bit complicated in this city. I found that place ""Thein Yadanar Money Exchange"" who did it at this ratio 1‚Ç¨= 4600 Kyats. I converted 100‚Ç¨.
In Mandalay, you will be closer to the ""fighting zone"" even if i didn't see anything. 
My hotel gave me some advices that i have respected: 
- don't go on the other side of the Irrawady river, that means that i couldn't visit Sagaing and Mingun. But know that you can pass, just have to take your own responsibilities.
- don't go out of the hotel after 10 pm. Even if there is no ""night lockdown"", the Rebel attacked the royal palace many times during previous month and every time during the night. So better to avoid to be taken in a cross fire exchange.

Leaving the country by Mandalay International Airport to Bangkok.
Be careful at the Airport because there is no money exchanger on the departure zone, means that if you too much Kyats, you will be not available to convert it at the airport.


Personal tips and advices:

- The currency rate is complicated: there is the official one  at 2300 Kyats for 1‚Ç¨ and the ""Black market"" one that can be higher as 4900 Kyats for 1 ‚Ç¨. So there is a huge gap between Official and Black Market and peoples that give you a price in Euros or Dollars, use anything between this 2 rates to convert in Kyats. Sometimes it can be good for you, sometimes not.
- There is no nightlife in Myanmar (from what i saw). Especially in Mandalay most of the restaurant close at 8pm, maximum 9pm. So anticipation is the word.
- Hotel can be expensive on web platform (like trip.com, agoda, booking) and not all are present on it. So you can look on google maps, and call them directly to ask if they have room and at which price. Even for the one on platform call them and ask the price in Kyats (they will first give you a price in US dollars and convert it in Kyars at the ratio of their choice), with ""ratio game"" can be a lot more cheaper to skip the platform that gives the price in Euros.
- Internet is shitty in Myanmar and Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp are blocked by government. You should use a VPN (notice that not all the VPN works... Myanmar people use ""NowVPN"" that works not so bad)
- Electricity shutdown happened everytime, so avoid the lift elevator and if you are on a cheap hotel maybe they will not have a powerful generator that can run the A/C so... can be hot.
- Be prepared with real poverty, it is as poor as India even more at some point.

About safety:

At no moment i feeled unsecure. While you stay on the ""no fighting zone"", it's a safe country in my opinion.
People will tell you when it is not safe to go.

There is military checkpoint all along roads but they don't care about you. I had absolutely no problem with authority, to be honest most of them smile me.",31,2024-10-18 03:23:18,B0z0_7he_c10wn,0.78

1gb7k6d,9 stays with booking.com over 8 weeks in Eastern Europe here's what I learned and some tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gb7k6d/9_stays_with_bookingcom_over_8_weeks_in_eastern/,64,"I did an 8 week trip to Europe with the vast majority of stays being apartment types mostly booked on booking.com and 2 with abnb. I only had one stay that wasn't up to expectations but for the most part everything went smoothly. Countries included Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia. 

Breakdown  
3 bookings direct  
1 on Agoda  
9 on Booking.com  
2 on abnb  

Here is what I learned and some tips.

Only book stays with more than 9+ rating, 20 reviews and at least a few positive recent reviews. Booking doesn't automatically sort reviews by newest, so be careful of that. Also seeing several different languages also shows more likely real reviews. IME, people only review if it is very good or very bad and not if it's just okay. No recent reviews is a red flag. 

Most places listed on booking are also listed on abnb and other sites. Sometimes one site is cheaper or has better cancellation options than others. Also looking at abnb gets you more reviews to look at. Booking tended to be cheaper than abnb and had the best cancellation options, but occasionally abnb did which is where I went to abnb.

Booking.com's mobile app is sometimes significantly cheaper than the desktop. I found it hard to search the mobile app so I would search on the website, find my spot and then compare prices on to the mobile app. A pain, but saved me 100s of $$ over several stays. Also, the mobile app lets you message the host before booking whereas that option is only available after on the web version. In the few places booking direct was an options, Booking.com, Agoda and Expedia were still often cheaper and easy to mange. 

Booking generally doesn't tell you if there are stairs or elevator available. Not a problem for me, but in a lot of places in Europe 1st floor tends to be up a flight of stairs. I try to mention it in my review so other people can see it. 

Booking doesn't distinguish between somewhere having a washer and a washer and dryer. If a dryer is important to you, message the host. 


If traveling with 2 people, look for places that have comfy sofa for sleeping on. Unfortunately, we hit a heatwave and sleeping with 2 people in a smaller European bed was uncomfortable. The A/C tends to be in the living area and doesn't always cool off the bedroom if separate.

Have WhatsApp on your phone before you go. I didn't have WhatsApp and I couldn't register for it once I was abroad because it won't accept Google Voice. My bad, but I thought I could send and receive international texts on Google Voice. Many hosts preferred to be contacted through WhatsApp before and during the stay for instructions and such. One place wanted to send a video of parking instructions and couldn't through the booking messaging. 

Reasons for booking was most places I went didn't have western hotels (or any hotels) near the city center, most of my stays were 4-7 days so I wanted a kitchen and laundry, wanted a bit more space than a hotel room could provide.

I have used booking many times over the years and never had any problems. I know it comes up every once in awhile on this sub, so I wanted to share if you use common sense, you can use booking safely. Outside of the US where there aren't a lot of chains and booking direct isn't feasible, booking is a good booking tool. I also highly encourage you to review spots as that is very helpful to everyone.

Using these guidelines, I didn't have any major problems. Only one spot wasn't up to par and frankly it was a desperation booking that had an 8.5 rating, but a good location and parking near a city center which was important. It was habitable, but had problems (leaking shower, no hand soap, just not very nice).",36,2024-10-24 12:00:34,youdontknowmeor,0.77

I‚Äôm living in USA and returning from Japan and South Korea and was wondering what destinations are more vegetarian friendly. 

Japan was good in the big cities (Tokyo, Kyoto) but certainly had to do research on where to go. Busan (SK) in the other hand was very hard and had to eat dinner at the same place every day. 

Last year I had a blast in Italy and super easy to find vegetarian food even without planning (vegetarian protein was hard besides chessee). 

From other countries I have been: Spain was very hard as well other than chesse. Mexico was relatively easy (I have been all over). Israel was easy. Costa Rica was very hard. Cuba was very hard too. Colombia was ok in big cities with planning (Medellin). Canada and US are also easy in big cities (US not very much in the south)

I ‚Äòm thinking on going to Switzerland and Iceland in the next 1-2 years are those vegetarian friendly?

I called American Airlines today to change my return trip and cut off the second leg. So instead of going from A - B - C, I'll just be going A - B, with my final destination being my parents' city. They told me it would be $500 to make that change and the agent lowkey suggested skiplagging instead.

I'm down to do it because there's no way in hell I'm spending $500 to keep the same flight path I was already on but remove my final leg, but I'm worried about getting in trouble with the airline.

I already won't have checked bags but what's the best way to go about this? Do I land in my parent's city and then cancel my remaining ticket? Go to the gate agent and claim I'm sick and will be staying? Do nothing at all?

1gjmg6j,Colombia Trip Report,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gjmg6j/colombia_trip_report/,49,"Recently took a trip to Colombia (with a small side quest to Panama).

Thought I'd share some of my opinons, thoughts, my itinerary as well as the costs. I took a late night flight out of London direct to Bogota, but connected to a flight to Cartagena. This was a self-transfer so I left 6 hours between flights to transfer in Bogota, which was also the cheaper option. Turns out my flight landed an hour early (2:30am as opposed to 3:30am) and customs and immigration was super efficient. but I was unable to transfer to the earlier flight at 4am and all other flights had seemingly sold out, so I just had to turtle it out in the airport and try to nap. The domestic gates are not ideal for napping, as there are some very loud announcements, though I did find a quiet corner in some gates downstairs. Theres ample water fountains and wi-fi so it turned out OK in the end.

**Cartagena - 2 Days**  
**Day 1**¬†\- This was my first stop, dropping my bags at the hotel at 11AM, I was straight off to the city to explore. Walking around, I explored the old town, the Baluarte de Santo Domingo, City Walls and soaked in the atmosphere in some of the Plazas. Tried some Lechon which was delicious for lunch.  
**Day 2**¬†\- I checked out Fuerte San Felipe de Barajas, then once again went back to the old town to soak in the atmosphere and walk around.¬†

[Baluarte de Santo Domingo](https://preview.redd.it/1orsod3pmxyd1.jpg?width=348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b37c04b5f79328e27a6e628e0bd48b1701faf7)

There is not much else to do here unless you're into nightlife (which I am not) or checking out some of the beautiful islands (which I do not have money to do). There was a great lively atmosphere and I understand why lots of people come here for the nightlife, though I was happy to only spend 2 days here.

**Medellin - 4 Days**  
**Day 3**¬†\- I took an early AM flight out of CTG to MDE - I was able to roll out of bed about 90 mins before the flight as my hotel was on the airports doorstep. Arriving into Medellin, I took a bus to the city, getting dropped off behind San Diego Mall. A 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station I was able to buy my transit pass and make my way to my Hotel. Dropping off my bags, I went exploring again. Though first I had a classic Bandeja Paisa. This kind of reminded me of the much loved Full English Breakfast in the UK, so I really enjoyed it. I then checked out Museo El Castillo and Santafe Mall. I'm not typically someone who goes to malls but it was interesting seeing the sort of stores they had, and also found a great place to get Paletas in the mall. I made my way back up to my hotel, grabbing some Empanadas for dinner.

**Day 4 -**¬†I went to Pueblito Paisa, which was an interesting first panoramic view of the city, though the ""Pueblito"" itself was fairly basic and had some replicas of old colonial style buildings. I then went to Comuna13, which was fun to see - it was vibrant and loud and interesting to make my way up as high as I could. I found a quiet spot deeper into the Comuna and watched the sunset and lights turn on over the city - it was a beautiful view. After this, I made my way all the way back down, then made the journey to another view point. This required a cable car then about half hour hike through some fairly dodgy neighbourhoods. Once I got to the viewpoint though, it was all worth it, the view was stunning.

**Day 5**¬†\- I'd heard a lot about Parque Arvi, and as someone who enjoys hikes through nature I thought I'd go check it out. This was an interesting journey requiring a Metrocable journey then switching to another super long cable car journey (15 mins non-stop). I don't consider myself scared of heights but Cable Cars have always felt a bit funny to me with the way they shake and move around. The view up was worth it though, seeing the entire city from above during the day. Getting to the park itself was a bit of a let down however, theres a fairly expensive secured trail, or you can ""take the risk"" and walk on other trails but they seemed to be mostly rural roads. The weather had also taken a turn for the worse. I walked along one trail but it was so wet and slippery that I decided I'd had enough after that. I made the long journey all the way back down into the city, heading to the Parque Natural Cerro El Volador. Here I watched the sunset and again saw the night lights start to flicker on. I stayed up here for so long that a security guard came and kicked me out as it turns out the park closes at 5PM! Well worth getting chewed out in Spanish though.

**Day 6 -**¬†Upon arriving, my hotel host insisted on a guided tour to Guatap√©. It looked interesting but I kinda brushed it off as I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 100k COP on a day out. I wasn't even sure I would have time to go. I decided I'd try my luck at doing it myself. I find guided tours to be sometimes rushed, sometimes too slow - I just prefer to set my own pace. I took a bus from Terminal del Norte, which took about 2 hours to get to. It was a fun physical experience to climb the Rock of Guatape, and theres some fantastic views. I then walked to the old town which was about 40 minutes walk, and thought cute its fairly small and I had seen everything I wanted after about an hour. I made my way back to Medellin, ate a Sancocho which was delicious and then packed my bag.

Medellin was the city I was most excited to visit on this trip - I'd seen videos of the city crawling up the sides of the valley and how pretty it looks at night. I was not disappointed at all. Every night I went to a different spot to view the lights and had my breath taken away. I stayed in the El Poblado area which is gentrified but safe. I do wish I was able to spend an extra day or two here though as there was so much more I would like to see. I will be back for sure.¬†

**Panama City - 2 Days**  
**Day 7 -**¬†¬†Took an early morning flight to Panama City. Weather here scuppered my plans, I had a stroll along the Cinta Costera down along to San Felipe and the Panama Canal Museum. San Felipe was a beautiful little colonial town, and the museum was interesting, though I was extremely unlucky in being there at the same time as a very rowdy school group.¬†  
**Day 8 -**¬†Second morning I was planning to hike up the Cerro Ancon Reserve, but again the weather was pretty bad and I didn't really want to be climbing a hill in the rain to potentially have a pretty cloudy and grey view. Sort of had a bit of a lie in as I was a little bit drained from the past week. Took an Uber to Panama Viejo and then another Uber to Miraflores Visitor Centre to check out the Panama Canal. This was extremely cool to see in person, though the ticket was a bit pricey. Took a bus back into the city, visiting Albrook Mall for a fast food dinner and an early night.¬†

I was a bit unlucky with my time in Panama - the weather was pretty bad with plenty of heavy rain, and this seemed to cause problems with the municipal sewage system because it smelt like sewage everywhere I went in the city, especially close to the coast. This also stopped my checking out Metropolitan National Park and Cerro Ancon Reserve, so I had to rearrange my plans, though I was happy I managed to get in some more rest time. Whilst I don't think I'll go out of my way to visit Panama again, with how Copa connects most of Latin America I think it is inevitable I will spend more time there in the future - hopefully with some better luck.¬†

**Bogota - 3 Days**  
**Day 9 -**¬†¬†As usual, a morning flight, land into Bogota before lunch. Grab a bus to my hotel - though I misread somewhere that you cold use contactless card, I forgot to buy the Tarjeta Tullave but the bus driver let me on anyways. Very lucky here. There is a kiosk in the airport just at the exit to the bus stops which I completely missed. Dropped my bags at the hotel and instantly feel the altitude sickness hit me. I'm asthmatic and the shortness of breath and dizziness hit me hard. Luckily in Colombia you can purchase many medicines without a prescription, so I got some¬†**Acetazolamide**¬†and refilled on my asthma inhalers whilst here as they are so cheap. The medication worked fairly quickly and I was ready to get on with the rest of the day. Purchased my travel pass at the nearest Transmilenio stop I went to check out the Museo Nacional de Colombia then walked along Carrera 7 down to Plaza de Bolivar. Picked up some souvenirs and soaked in the atmosphere - there was A LOT going on. Its colourful, noisy, chaotic and I generally enjoyed it.¬†

[Plaza de Bolivar](https://preview.redd.it/0j7fudylnxyd1.jpg?width=348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=020214446f3283d6dc6d6b60dbf74ff44985e23a)

**Day 10 -**¬†I was fairly fatigued on this day, I'm unsure if it was related to the altitude sickness or maybe the fact I'd been going at it full pelt for 10 days at this point. Had a lie in and then checked out the Grafiti District, Botanical Garden, Simon Bolivar Park and then Zona T. The Botanical Garden and Simon Bolivar Park weren't really too special to go out of my way for so I somewhat regret it.¬†

[Botanical Garden](https://preview.redd.it/it2vzzwlnxyd1.jpg?width=348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2ab4dcfb1a28753cde7a9466584b5f5608cc076)

**Day 11 -**¬†My last day üôÅ My flight back home was at 11PM however, so I still had the entire day. I checked out as late as I could, then headed back down towards Plaza Bolivar. My original intentions were to hike up to Monseratte, but with how I was still adjusting to the altitude, I decided to err on the side of caution and take the cable car insted. It is quite an experience being up at 10.5k feet/3k metres. The view was stunning, and you're able to see the other side which is green covered mountains. I headed back down, but unfortunately as it was a Monday, the Museo del Oro and Museo Santa Clara were closed. This is a complete oversight on my part, and had I known I probably would have flipped Day 10 and 11 around. I walked down to Plazoleta Los Martires, which I do not recommend - theres some interesting colonial architecture but the area is very very dodgy. I went back to my hotel in Zona T, had some dinner and then made my way to the airport arriving at about 9PM for my 11:30PM departure.¬†

[View from Monserrat](https://preview.redd.it/dcxoqzwlnxyd1.jpg?width=348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4387abdf28e22e6d743b1a4fb48ac2c1f822f0e4)

I think a lot of tourists skip Bogota because they hear bad things about it. Its dirty, theres a lot of poverty, but honestly it felt so gritty and grounded I loved it. I wish I had more time here - there are so many waterfalls and cool hikes to do in the areas surrounding the city, but I would need to fully acclimate to the altitude for that.  
Transmilenio has to be the most complicated Transit system I have ever used. When first seeing the map I thought the colours referred to individual lines, but they refer to ""trunks"" and bus routes operate down a combination of these different trunks. The majority of buses also do not serve all of the stops on the trunks, so you need to know which bus route to get. With so many buses operating along these trunk routes, the buses stop at different points along the platform. Some of these bus platforms are so long that there is only a matter of 20-30 metres in between the individual bus stops in some places. Once you get the hang of things it kind of makes sense ? But even Google Maps gets confused and seems to completely avoid integrating the BRT routes into transportation options in the city. Instead, you have to use Moovit, which whilst it gives you directions, sometimes doesn't offer the most efficient routes and is also plagued with adverts. The last thing I want to do when referencing my directions is have my phone out in the open for another 5-10 seconds waiting for this ad to finish.¬†

**Overall thoughts:**

I'm a very fast paced traveller. I get bored in one place too easily if I'm there for too long. My time was limited by work and Annual Leave requirements. I do not really get easily exhausted from taking flights, and do not consider it a chore/tedious. I know a lot of people seem to consider needing to dedicate a whole day to travelling, but in my opinion, if your trip is fairly short then you can afford to spend the energy travelling in the morning and then exploring in the afternoon. I also have a lot of stamina - I walked on average 25k steps a day for the whole trip. My shoes soles wore out pretty brutally. A lot of what I walked could easily have been Uber'd if a bit more pressed for time, but I really enjoy soaking up the neighbourhoods as I go between places.¬†

I'm lucky in the sense that I'm ethnically ambiguous and able to blend in to a wide variety of countries. I'm not Latin American but I have frequently been mistaken for a local in Mexico, and now, Colombia - with museum staff asking me for my local ID so I can get the national rate, then me having to inform them I am a tourist. This fact helped me blend in when walking through some dodgier neighbourhoods, as well as not get approached by tourist traps (tour guides, souvenir sales people). Colombia is a very diverse country and I think many people could pass as a local with the right mannerisms.

A basic command of Spanish is needed. Many hospitality staff I interacted with did not speak English, even at museums and hotels - I did stay at 2 or 3 star hotels. I don't speak Spanish, though I am Filipino and our language has a heavy % of Spanish loan words. That, along with the fact I speak French (a related Romance language) helped me navigate Spanish signage as well as communicate some of my ideas with the locals. I know enough Spanish phrases to get by, but regret not investing more time in learning Spanish to connect with locals, many of whom were up for a conversation. I also made sure to have Spanish downloaded on my Google Translate app for a last resort in some situations.

Honestly, I think I fell in love with Colombia and its people. I want to have a better command of Spanish next time, instead of fumbling around the language like a toddler.

Thought I‚Äôd add this in so everyone is aware. I am an Indian passport holder with a UK indefinite leave to remain. Which makes me entitled for Visa on Arrival.

Yesterday I was suppose to fly out to Dubai for holiday but was refused check in at the airport. Their reason for refusal was the fact that my BRP expires on 31st December 2024 and I did not have 6 months on it to travel. As many of you may know ALL BRP‚Äôs are now set to expire on expire on 31st December 2024 due to home office moving to evisas‚Äô. I tried showing them my evisa, even asked if they wanted a share code but to no avail. The UAE website says anybody with a UK resident visa is allowed but like I said nothing. In the end I just gave up and came home. Was I rejected for the right reasons? Do I have any grounds to appeal this? How do I appeal this?

Grateful for all the help. TIA!",33,2024-11-03 04:29:00,Environmental_Cook95,0.65
1gd8dxd,"Wallet got stolen, but it magically came back",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gd8dxd/wallet_got_stolen_but_it_magically_came_back/,49,"Last night I was at a station in Lyon, France trying to catch an express train to the airport. My wallet got stolen, but someone brought it back to me within seconds, with all cash and cards intact. I still can‚Äôt fathom how the wallet got returned so fast. Sharing this as a warning to travelers- 

I was just about to buy a ticket from the kiosk when a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù came over and tried to guide me through the steps, which were in French. I didn‚Äôt think too much about it and let her click on the screen. 

We reached the point where I pay, so I took out my card from my wallet and tapped, ticket came out, I picked it up, thought I was done and ready to leave. However the ‚Äúhelper‚Äù kept saying that what I got was not a ticket, which left me very confused. She suggested that my card didn‚Äôt work, and I should try again. I tried to back out because I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, and there was a line behind me. Then she made it look like I was about to evade fare. 

I took out another card and temporarily put my wallet in my pocket on the side where she stood (obvious mistake) and tried to buy another ticket. She again told me that my card didn‚Äôt work. I read a little bit of French and I saw ‚Äúbillet disponible‚Äù clearly printed on the screen this time, so I knew she‚Äôs bullshitting me. My friend also got her ticket and confirmed with someone in line that what she got, which was the exact same as mine, was a valid ticket.  

At this point, I already had two tickets and the train was arriving. We hopped on the train. The ‚Äúhelper‚Äù stepped aside and didn‚Äôt seem like she planned to get on. Seconds after we got on the train, a girl came up to me with my wallet, at which point I finally realized what happened. 

I checked my wallet- turned out everything‚Äôs still there, nothing lost. Granted I didn‚Äôt carry any euros, and all my cash were small bills in other currencies.

The conductor checked in with us too, saying that they noticed suspicious activities and asked if my wallet‚Äôs ok. Got our tickets scanned, train left. 

So‚Ä¶that was a lesson. Obviously I got lucky, but how did I get my wallet back like that? Perhaps a nice bystander stopped the thief and returned my wallet? Or the person returning the wallet was part of the scam, and they decided to give it back because there‚Äôs no cash? The train left too fast before I could confirm what happened.

Tldr: thief tried to distract me when I was buying tickets, talked me into buying an extra ticket, stole my wallet, but someone brought back my wallet immediately. 

Thank you all for the advice!!",37,2024-10-27 05:56:32,IrishCreamTea,0.88

1ghjjmt,I just bought a round trip Greyhound ticket from MS to Nashville. How screwed am I?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ghjjmt/i_just_bought_a_round_trip_greyhound_ticket_from/,43,"I [26F] just booked everything for a trip to Nashville later this month. By far, the hardest part of the planning process was figuring out how the heck I'm even gonna get there. I live in rural Mississippi, so my transportation options are very limited. I've rode Amtrak a few times and loved it but unfortunately, there are no direct train routes from MS to Nashville. As for flights, it would cost around $500+ to fly a convoluted flight route all around the South and an overnight layover just to get to Nashville. I don't have a car, and I don't have anyone in my life willing to drive me 5 and a half hours to Nashville.

So Greyhound is unfortunately my only realistic travel option. I can get my Mom or someone to drive me to the nearest station, which is about 40 min away. I will take the local non-Greyhound bus to Memphis (which will drop me off late at night I may add). From there, I will transfer to the actual Greyhound bus from Memphis to Nashville. 

I'm not really worried about the first leg of the trip since the buses from the locally owned line are pretty nice. It's the nearly 4 hour ride from Memphis to Nashville that has me worried. I was well aware of Greyhound's bad reputation before I booked, but like I said, this is my only option. My question to anyone who has ever rode the Greyhound from Memphis to Nashville, how bad was it? I should also add that I am traveling solo and all of this will be happening at late night/early morning, so safety is a concern for me. This isn't my first time traveling solo, but this will be my first time taking Greyhound. I'm also concerned about waiting at the Memphis station at night for all those hours. Realistically, a 4 hour trip shouldn't be that bad, right???",68,2024-11-01 18:53:19,Goatwhorehoodmoments,0.7

I have confirmed this with my nearest Chinese embassy.

Prior to booking the flight there was no notice of the visa requirement and I incorrectly assessed that I would be visa exempt. Is the airline responsible in any way or is this my bad?

1gs1nwd,Why we still use OTAs,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gs1nwd/why_we_still_use_otas/,43,"We've all heard the horror stories about OTAs leaving travelers stranded when flights get canceled or schedules change. The ""book direct"" crowd never misses a chance to say ""I told you so"" whenever someone posts about an OTA nightmare.
BUT... as someone who regularly travels as a family of four, I'm here to make a case for why OTAs still deserve a place in our travel planning toolkit.
Here's the thing: those savings that might seem modest when booking a single ticket can turn into serious money when multiplied by 4+ people. I recently booked our family's holiday flights through an OTA and saved $78 per ticket compared to the airline's direct price. That's over $300 total - enough to cover a nice dinner out or a fun activity at our destination.
 tips from my experience:
Always immediately grab the airline confirmation number and verify the booking on the airline's website
Screenshot everything during the booking process
Stick to the well-known OTAs (Expedia, Bookingdotcom, Tripdotcom etc.)
Read the fare rules carefully before booking
Don't book complicated multi-leg journeys through OTAs
Yes, there's slightly more risk involved. But for straightforward flights where you're fairly certain your plans won't change, the savings can make it worthwhile - especially for families. That money adds up over multiple trips per year.

Thought I share my dumb experience so that somebody will learn from my mistake.



So, was searching for a round trip to Turkey and  eDreams site had the best price, although only under 100 EUR cheaper than it would have been if bought directly from airline(Pegasus). Bought the tickets. 

Fast forward a week and Pegasus informed me about cancellation of the return flight. Sadly, there were no good alternatives to change to too, however Pegasus was willing to cancel and refund both flights in full. Did so, only to realise, that  227 EUR of the total sum of 1578 EUR had been a eDreams service fee.  Okay, fair enough. Probably lost that.

But the story does not end there. Not only does eDreams not refund the service fee, but they sent me an invoice in a sum of another 288 EUR. So this will also be deducted from any refund. 

But the story does not end there either. I bought the ticket from eDreams with a full insurance, in case on a cancellation in any circumstance. Really, like paid extra 72 EUR for the cancellation insurance from eDreams.

1gebff0,Traveling as a couple in major cities.  How do you fill in your time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gebff0/traveling_as_a_couple_in_major_cities_how_do_you/,38,"Just got back from a 3 week trip with my fiance in Spain and Portugal.  We ate and drank our way through these countries and while we had an amazing time, we found some days very lacking in terms of excitement.

Our typical day (not traveling to another city), would be wake up (late), have breakfast at a cafe or hotel if it was free, go on a walking tour, maybe see a historical site (Alcazar, Alhambra, Sagrada, etc) and then dinner (tapas and wine).  We'd hit up music bars that I had on my list which were nice and some of the more enjoyable activities.

However towards the end of our trip, we found it getting repetitive with just eating, drinking and sightseeing.  We aren't into shopping minus a few souvenirs and that's one thing that attracts tourism.  I found as a couple, we didn't really have any engaging activities.  In our day to day life back home, we have our hobbies, our friends and family to hang out with and talk to along with our jobs.  We talked about how we missed stuff like working out, doing yoga/spin classes, cooking dinner, etc.

We've traveled for the same amount of time to South America and Central America and found ourselves never trying to fill in the time because we were busy doing outdoor activities (hiking, swimming/beach, ATVing), however major cities (Barcelona, Lisbon, Seville) seemed to really lack a lot of engaging activities as a couple.  Most of the ""experiences"" in major cities were: Walking tours, pub crawls, food tours, and maybe a cooking class.  We didn't find any interesting tours that provided more than a walking tours (for instance in Oaxaca, I went on a tour that included Mezcal tasting, waterfall hike, swimming, and a food tour).

I've solo traveled before and found myself rarely getting bored or repetitive.....I'm staying at hostels sometimes so I'm engaging with more people (no I won't stay at a hostel with my fiance...we need our comforts as a couple lol).  I can pick up and engage in more activities as a solo traveler.  Eating meals is quicker and often times more  fullfilling since I can eat what I want to eat, not what we want to eat as a couple and because when I'm traveling as a solo traveler, I'm usually in LATAM or SE Asia, there tends to be more interesting tours that cover multiple activities).

Hey everyone, I need to share my experience with you about Kiwi.com. The company where everything's great until you hit a snag? Then it turns into a complete nightmare and you kick yourself for ever using them.

I booked two business class tickets with self-transfers:

Paris to Madrid AND Madrid to Bogota

About 10 days later, they email me saying my Madrid-Bogota flight was ""delayed"" and would arrive earlier, so I would miss it and would not have time to do the self transfer. To fix this, I needed to drop $3,000 on a new Madrid-Bogota. I kind of ignored it since I figured I'd just adjust the Paris-Madrid flight myself.

Then, 2 days later, they hit me with another email claiming ""the **airline canceled my flight**"" (See the screenshot, no room for misinterpretation here). They wanted me to click their option button to buy:

A new $3,000 Madrid-Bogota ticket

AND a new Paris-Madrid ticket for about $400

I immediately called both airlines:

Air Europa: ""Nope, nothing's canceled or changed. You're still good to go.""

Iberia: They surprisingly told me that since it was a business, I could change to a later flight for free.

I flew last week on both airlines, which **NEVER CANCELED** any of my flights, without extra costs, everything was smooth.

Kiwi tried to squeeze an extra $3,400 out of me when they could have just guide me or be fair and told me to contact airlines. Or simply not tried to sell me tickets I didn't need.

I know my way around travel booking and stuff, but imagine if this happened to someone's grandparent not as saavy or someone who doesn't book flights often. They probably would've panicked and paid up just to make sure they didn't lose their flight.

**Stay away from Kiwi. Pure and simple. They are not honest in their methods and it will be good until it's not so why take the risk.**

Just want to know if anyone has experiences with being married to someone who does not like to travel, and if anyone here has done solo travel whilst being married?

I was lucky to have had the opportunity to travel with my parents growing up, and I spent some time in my early 20s travelling. It is something that I really enjoyed and didn't really want to stop doing, but life got in the way and now I'm in my mid-30s and married to the love of my life. She has no desire to travel internationally, and for the past five years we've been travelling domestically, and it has been amazing to see more of Australia,, but im really getting the itch to go back overseas, and to continue to travel overseas somewhat regularly (meaning once every year or two). 

I'm a teacher and next year I'll be going into a job that gives me 3 weeks off in the middle of the year, which coincides with the northern hemispheres summer. This would work perfectly with travelling for 2 weeks at a time. We are also in a financial position to be able to afford me going away, as I'll still be paid for these three weeks and will be able to save a few thousand a month.

For years ive tried to convince my wife to travel overseas and she wont. Finally, my wife and I spoke and she suggested that I travel without her. This was done in a fully supportive manner. So I'm going to start this next year.

So I was just wondering if anyone else had experience living with someone who doesn't like travel, or who do travel without their partner? Thanks

\- Savannah/Charleston

\- Boston

 \- Utah ""Mighty 5"" Parks - from SLC or Vegas (this would likely be a 9-10 day trip).

I know some people have a great time on their trips and even go multiple times. However, I wanted to share my less-than-great experience. 

In March 2024, my sister and I went on a trip to Japan with EF Ultimate Break. My sister had used them before (2018) and thought her experience was good. I should mention that I‚Äôm almost aged out of their bracket (33), so I expected younger people on the trip. We booked our 8-day Tokyo trip 8 months in advance. The payment plan was helpful, making paying for the trip less stressful. We thought the itinerary sounded fun, but things didn‚Äôt go as smoothly as we hoped.

 We didn‚Äôt get our flight and hotel information until a couple of weeks before the trip. Our flight was from Seattle to South Korea, with a 3-hour layover, and then to Tokyo. Other people leaving from Seattle got non-stop flights to Tokyo, which made no sense to me. I can only assume that EF bought the flights so late that there weren‚Äôt enough seats on the non-stop, so they put us on a different flight. Other people on our trip had weird flight routes too, like Texas to Canada and then Canada to Tokyo. EF doesn‚Äôt give you any options on flights; they just pick whatever, which is annoying. For an 8-day trip, 2 days were just airplane travel. We were the last group to arrive in Tokyo at 10 PM, while most people got there around 2 PM. Our first tour was at 8 AM the next morning, making it hard to adjust to the time difference after arriving so late. 

I didn‚Äôt like our tour guide at all. He was condescending and frustrating. He gave us incorrect information about Japan (we fact-checked him on the spot and found he was wrong). It was clear he was just there to party with the younger people (he even asked people to go out for drinks). A couple of days into the trip, my sister and I got extremely sick. I messaged him on the EF app for ER information, but he ignored us, saying he couldn‚Äôt help. I called the emergency EF customer service number, and they said he was supposed to help us. Suddenly, 10 minutes later, he knocked on our door, saying he was calling local hospitals. We ended up walking to the closest hospital the next morning and got the help we needed. Japanese hospitals are very helpful and great if you ever need help there. Our tour guide didn‚Äôt check on us until 3 days later, while the EF customer service person called us daily to see how we were doing. We decided not to go on any more tours or communicate with our guide after that.

 Another issue was with the hotel EF picked. Their website said we would stay in Tokyo, but we were 45 minutes away in a very small business hotel. The room was so small that we had to climb over our luggage to get to our mattress. The town we stayed in was cool, and we had a good time exploring it, but we felt scammed by EF‚Äôs claim we would stay in Tokyo. 

Overall, if you‚Äôre younger and want to travel to another country by yourself, this MIGHT be a good option. Personally, I could have booked everything on this tour myself and had a much better time. Japan is an easy country to explore and travel around. I‚Äôm going back next year and have booked everything myself. My trip is longer, includes more cities, and will be about the same price as what I paid with EF. I hope someone finds this helpful when considering booking with EF.",4,2024-10-18 16:46:46,britt_and_woofs,0.91

Peru is beautiful!!! If you are considering it, you need to go! First of all if you are going to hike anything near Cusco, take some days to acclimate to the high altitude. We only had 24 hrs in Cusco before our 2 day Inca Trail hike to Machu Picchu and my breathing was horrible. I needed to take a break after every incline.  The altitude makes all the hikes including Machu Picchu, Humantay Lake and Rainbow mountain very hard. The hardest one altitude wise was Rainbow mountain. I had just started the hike and my head was already starting to hurt. Someone else from our group didn't make it to the top because she needed oxygen, so please beware. We were on coca leaves and Agua de Florida. Other people we met had been in Cusco for a couple of days. Everyone's body is different, but please take that into consideration

Airport transportation: We used Taxidatum in Lima and Cusco. You need to book through their website, WhatsApp or email. They are very punctual. 

General Transportation: We used uber in Lima, and in Cusco everything was walking distance. For the day tours they picked us up in our hostel. 

ATM: There were two ATMs near baggage claim at the Lima Airport. 

Cash: Several places take card if it is touristy, but for stands in the street and smaller shops they only take cash and won't have change for big bills. In Lima I would go to the big markets and pay with a big bill to get smaller bills. In Cusco it was a little bit harder, so I went to the exchanges houses and they charged a small fee to get change. 

Beware there is a lot of traffic like in most cities! Incorporate extra timing into your plans for traffic.

We obviously had to scrap that whole plan and settled on a new holiday to Guadalajara. Booked hotels? Check. Prepaid tours? Check. Feeling confident? **BIG MISTAKE**! Because less than two weeks out, they cancel ***again***.

And, just to twist the knife, guess why I even booked Frontier in the first place?

Their one ‚Äúsolution‚Äù? Rebook within five days before or after the original flight. Cool, except for one problem‚ÄîNO FLIGHTS are available within that window. In fact, ***no flights*** at all outside the window either. They say they're ""sorry"" for the inconvenience, yet the same flights are mysteriously available if I try booking through Capital One. **My partner's convinced they oversold the flights and are quietly kicking us voucher holders off to make room for those who paid full fare.**

And then the cherry on top: ***‚ÄúWe always hope to give you the best experience‚Ä¶this situation is unexpected for us.‚Äù*** Is it, though? They‚Äôve canceled back-to-back trips, and all they do is throw polite but empty words at us.

We (husband &amp; wife, early 40s, decently well-traveled) recently returned from two weeks (Oct. 11 - 27) in this area of Europe and I thought I would report back on our trip. We have been to Italy (Naples, Rome, Orvieto, Florence, Pisa, Cinque Terre, and Bologna) but not Venice or Milan, and this was our first time to both Slovenia and Switzerland.¬† This trip was MUCH less structured than our typical trips ‚Äì most of our schedules were open for simply exploring these places on foot.¬† I researched all of our destinations but we had very little purchased/scheduled in advance.¬† I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions about likes/dislikes or what we felt we did right/wrong.

3 nights/2.5 days in Ljubljana, which absolutely charmed the hell out of us.¬† Unbelievably friendly people, incredible food, fantastic wine, and just the best vibes.¬† We stayed in Old Town (our hotel was a 4^(th) floor walkup with a great view of the river, spacious in terms of European hotel rooms, budget-friendly, perfect location, with helpful and kind staff).¬† We pretty much just walked around the city, eating and drinking and taking photos, for 2.5 days.¬† Made friends with a wonderful bartender who recommended Vintgar Gorge.¬† Visited Ljubljana Castle, climbed the tower for beautiful views.¬† Peeked inside a church or two, did a little shopping, and did a Slovenian wine tasting with a great sommelier who really knew her stuff.¬† Picked up several bottles of wine to drink as we made our way through the rest of the trip (and one to bring home).

2 nights/2 days at Lake Bled.¬† This was the only portion of the trip during which we rented a car.¬† We wanted the flexibility to explore outside of Bled on our own schedules.¬† Truly beautiful.¬† Quite touristy (which we expected‚Ä¶ touristy places are touristy for a reason!)¬† Ate more good food, drank more good wine.¬† Visited Bled Castle and took a boat out to the island.¬† Rented an apartment just across the street from the lake.¬† Spent a few hours hiking at Vintgar Gorge, which was stunning (and not a difficult hike).¬† Well worth it!

2 nights/2.5 days in Venice.¬† Returned the car in Ljubljana and took a shared van (GoOpti) from Ljubljana to Venice.¬† We looked at taking a train, but it would‚Äôve doubled the transit time from 3 hours to 6.¬† GoOpti was affordable and efficient ‚Äì highly recommend.¬† (Though a bit crowded with nine people in a nine passenger van). ¬†Venice was incredible.¬† I did not expect to enjoy it as much as we did.¬† I expected the entire place to be crawling with people, but that was really only true around St. Mark‚Äôs Square.¬† Off the main area, we just wandered quiet alleys and ate cicchetti and drank spritzes.¬† The only organized thing we did in Venice was take the elevator up to the top of St. Mark‚Äôs Campanile where the views were incredible.¬† We purchased two day transit passes so that we could use the water buses, but mostly we walked everywhere.¬† Venice is unbelievably walkable.¬† We did take a water bus out to San Giorgio Maggiore at night to see the city lights.¬† Beautiful.¬† We otherwise didn‚Äôt get off the island.¬† Oh, we did do a gondola right which I was iffy about, but it was definitely one of those ‚Äúyou have to do it once‚Äù things and we really had fun.¬† Fantastic food all over Venice ‚Äì only had one meal that didn‚Äôt wow me (duck ragu).

3 nights/2.5 days in Milan.¬† Took an evening train, leaving Venice after dinner, to Milan.¬† Our apartment was super neat ‚Äì a sixth floor place with a private balcony with a fantastic view of the Duomo.¬† Even though we planned this trip just three weeks out, we were able to get tickets to see the Last Supper (that said, we had to pay several hundred for a guided tour, rather than just the 15e entry fee, because those sell out months in advance).¬† It was worth the money, though.¬† We visited Sforza Castle and saw Michelangelo‚Äôs unfinished Pieta, which was amazing.¬† If you‚Äôve been to Florence and have seen his ‚Äòhall of prisoners‚Äô at Accademia, it‚Äôs similar to those.¬† Astounding.¬† We did the timed ticket elevator to the Duomo rooftop and that was insane.¬† So cool to see the Duomo in various states of aging/repair, and to see all the intricate details up close.¬† The exit from the rooftop spits you out right inside the Duomo so it was super nice to get to skip the entry line for the interior, too.¬† Highly recommend that route.¬† We didn‚Äôt have a single bad meal in Milan.¬† I know it‚Äôs not a city that‚Äôs well known for food, but everything we had was wonderful.¬† We aren‚Äôt big shoppers so we did not do any shopping in Milan, including at any of the very high fashion places.¬†

3 days/3 nights in the Lauterbrunnen Valley.¬† We left Milan early and took a train to Lauterbrunnen, arriving by lunchtime.¬† I waffled about where to stay, but ultimately decided Lauterbrunnen would be the most convenient (I feel like that was the right decision for us).¬† Took the trains to Wengen, Grindelwald, and Murren (cable car).¬† Did the small hike up/behind Staubbach Falls, then walked a long way to take the cable car to Murren.¬† One of the most beautiful walks of my life.¬† Glad we skipped the bus for most of that route.¬† Our hotel in Lauterbrunnen was fantastic.¬† We had a balcony with a view of the falls, and a window with a view of the river/valley.¬† Breakfast was included and was generous and delicious!¬† It was foggy when we went to Wengen and Gridelwald.¬† Very clear skies when we went to Murren.¬† Grindelwald was by far the most touristy of the villages we visited, but we still enjoyed it.¬† We even played a round of mini golf while drinking Swiss beers.¬† So much fun.¬† This whole area blew our minds ‚Äì it was just insanely beautiful.

1.5 days/2 nights in Geneva.¬† Geneva was nice.¬† It‚Äôs a functioning, bustling city.¬† Old Town is really pretty.¬† We had a couple of really good meals, walked along the river front area, visited outside the UN headquarters.¬† Lots of walking and looking around.

Those who post here about how underrated Slovenia is ‚Äì are absolutely correct.¬† Slovenia was the sleeper hit of our trip.¬† We cannot wait to return.",11,2024-11-04 12:27:02,metallicmint,0.87

I'm heading home to England today.  I always wanted to visit and while I am in between jobs I decided to have my chance.  

I was originally meant to be spending only 19 days there but I extended my holiday to 25 days during my visit. 

It has been honestly a fantastic experience! If you ever wanted to go to New Zealand or wondering if you should visit, then I say do it! Do the south and the north islands!

I would say my best experience was a dolphin watching cruise and Hobbington in Auckland. I loved visiting both Milford and Doubtful Sound, the scenic flight from Milford sound was definitely a huge highlight. I also loved seeing the glow worms in some caves nearish Auckland.  

A highlight was also going on the Luge in Queenstown, it was a very quick experience but I loved it, going on a whale watching tour in Kaikoura and walking a three hour hike through a trail called Hookers Valley, was also a fantastic experience! 

I also loved visiting Castile hill as well! 

If you go to Christchurch I also definitely recommend going to Willowbank wildlife reserve and the Antarctic centre, there is a shuttle that goes to both places, anyway, and going on the Tram to explore the city centre! All fantastic experience! 

I loved my time here so much! I don't plan to come back simply because of the cost and I'd rather visit another new country if I go far away. 

It was a brilliant experience! Fairwell New Zealand! I'll always remember and miss these fantastic times! I miss them already and I haven't left just yet! Ha! ",12,2024-11-13 12:44:48,Purple_Feature1861,0.85

1gba6xe,Trip report : 4 days in Edinburgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gba6xe/trip_report_4_days_in_edinburgh/,23,"I just returned from my four day trip to Edinburgh. Gorgeous fall colors, intermittent rains, crazy winds on the last day and I loved every minute of it.

Transportation: Tram( airport &amp; other places ), Lothian buses but mostly on foot. Extremely walkable city.

Shoes: I contemplated two pairs of shoes but also wanted to pack the bare minimum, so my Asics gel did a fantastic job and dried up pretty fast even after rain. No discomfort / pain even averaging 30k steps each day.

Clothes : I packed layers, but sweaters and a waterproof jacket was enough. It was pleasant throughout - 55 to 60F.

Weather : it was mostly sunny, and the random rains followed by sun would always pop up the fall colors. Very picturesque. 

Stayed in Dean village which was a short walk to city center.

Food and drinks: No specific recommendations. Vegetarian and a teetotaler. I loved Wee Bonnie cafe, Dishoom, Pulse plant, Kochchi and all the coffee.

Itinerary:

Day 1: airport to early check in. Explored Dean village, Princes st gardens, Scott monument, sunset at Calton Hill, James Quarter mall for dinner. Highlight of the day: \*two rainbows &amp; sunset at Calton\*

Day 2: Edinburgh castle(skipped the tour), Royal mile - St Giles Cathedral, judiciary building, high court, supreme court, Writers museum, Cockburn Street, Greyfriars Bobby, University of Edinburgh and Scottish museum. Tip: visit the terrace at the museum for  spectacular city views. Vennel steps for uninterrupted view of Castle, Victoria street. Favorite : \*St Giles, Scottish museum\*.

Day 3:  Dean village, Leith walkway, Belford bridge, St Bernard's well, Stockbridge, Circus lane, Saint stephens, Botanical gardens, Palace of Holyroodhouse, Queen's drive for views of Arthur's seat and finally took a tour of Scottish Parliament building. Balmoral hotel. Favorites: \*Circus lane, Queen's drive, Leith walkway\*.

Day 4: this was the day of cyclone(!) so canceled the day trip to Glasgow.  Had no solid plans. Went to the National galleries and this was a pleasant surprise. Great art collection. Could easily spend half a day here. Gardens were closed, so went around the city again as the rains stopped. Took a random tram to see Queen's yacht and then back to royal mile and checked out a lot of random streets and alleys. Winds were absolutely crazy by evening so decided to call it a day and bid farewell to this colorful joyous city. Its the bittersweet moment of every trip.

I got a lot of useful information on this sub, so paying it forward. Happy travels.

I mostly travel overland by bicycle and come across lots of places in remote areas that only domestic tourists seem to frequent despite them being arguable more impressive than the main sights.

I was recently planning a trip through China and stumbled across a website that listed so many amazing natural or architectural sights that I never would've come across on your typical 'top 20 sights' tourist list. Some of my favourite travel memories are when you stumble across a place with virtually no other tourists and it feels almost 'hidden' compared the main tourist spots in a country.

Are there any similar websites to AtlasObscura that have documented interesting natural or architectural sights that aren't particularly famous so don't see much tourst traffic?

# Usual china advice apply I guess

Get trip.com on your phone, useful to book trains, hotel, and planes - don‚Äôt rely solely on booking.com it doesn‚Äôt have any offer in YanJing.  
Get both wechat AND alipay to work to pay (your wechat account won‚Äôt be verified and you won‚Äôt be able to use it to text, but you need the payment part because some ppl doesn‚Äôt accept alipay).

I just used apple maps and google maps. If you don't have an apple phone it's probably a good idea to have something else than google maps.

# How to get there by train

(There are roads there so you can also go by car).

The only very slow train to go there go from Neijiang to Zhaotong, here is on trip.com: [https://trip.com/trains/china/list?departureStation=ÂÜÖÊ±ü&amp;arrivalStation=Êò≠ÈÄö](https://trip.com/trains/china/list?departureStation=ÂÜÖÊ±ü&amp;arrivalStation=Êò≠ÈÄö) (once you click on the link, it won‚Äôt show the itinerary you need to select a date but it‚Äôs the same train everyday at the same time).  
On [trip.com](http://trip.com) you can check all the stops, one of them is Yanbin which may be practical depending on your itinary. I personally did (all by train except specified otherwise): ChongQing -&gt; ChangDu -&gt; Leshan -&gt; Yanbin -&gt; YanJing -&gt; Zhaotong -&gt; (by direct plane) -&gt; Kunming.  
So Yanbin was better than Naijiang for me. As you can see on this itinerary, there is a direct plane from Zhaotong to Kunming, you should check there might be a direct plane from Zhaotong to whoever you want to go or from elsewhere on the path from Neijiang to Zhaotong, china has a lot of airports you should check you may find a better itinerary than mine.

The station of Yanbin on [trip.com](http://trip.com) is named Cuiping.  
Go to the train station of Yanbin in advance, they were very confused with my non-china passport and it took some time.  
You don‚Äôt have to go to the station of YanJing in advance, there is no ¬´¬†security guard¬†¬ª in this station, but it‚Äôs a bit hard to find, when you go north from the bridge the road splits in two, take the left path and the train station is where the parking for cars is (on the right of the road), there is no explicit sign but it‚Äôs here, take the stairs and it‚Äôs at the very top.

On [trip.com](http://trip.com) you cannot buy a ticket from YanJing to Zhaotong for instance, it only works between (I guess) large cities. But it‚Äôs ok you go on the train without a ticket and pay there. Similarly you cannot buy a ticket from Yanbin to YanJing, I personally got a ticket from Yanbin to Zhaotong but it wasn‚Äôt found on their system anyway, so my guess is that you can go to the train station without a ticket too and buy it there.

There is 2 train station, YanJing and YanJing North. You want to go to stop YanJing North, the city is here, don‚Äôt stop at YanJing! Tell everyone you go to YanJing North right away (they didn‚Äôt let get off the train at YanJing North and there were no Didi once I was at YanJing üíÄ don‚Äôt make the same mistake).

Be careful Didi doesn‚Äôt work there.

There is a bullet train in construction between ChongQing and Kunming ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing‚ÄìKunming\_high-speed\_railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing‚ÄìKunming_high-speed_railway)), according to the engineer I met there it‚Äôll be done in 3years. I believe it won‚Äôt stop at YanJing, but it may stop close by which may give you better itinerary option than what I did.

1ggg1xi,"My Medellin, Colombia trip insight for future tourists",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ggg1xi/my_medellin_colombia_trip_insight_for_future/,18,"
I wanted to provide some insight after visiting Colombia, since I had some questions before visiting. First of all I highly recommend it! I visited Medellin, Colombia and I would totally revisit. The people are very welcoming and they are very nice and outgoing. Before our trip we were asked several time if we were nervous visiting and we were not. We had other friends that had visited and it was all great reviews. Our first language is Spanish, so it was easy for us to interact with locals etc. 

  
Airport transportation: From a previous post I was recommended to get a white taxi at the airport. Thats what we did. There are several people at the airport and they have a big sign outlining the prices depending where you are going. From the airport to Poblado they charged us 110,000 pesos. The sign is hung on the airport, so the price is fixed. Our taxi driver asked us if we wanted the taxi or the regular looking car. We said the regular car and someone sat in the front. During the ride the taxi driver was telling us that he recommends a normal car because if its a taxi car driving from the airport you could be prone to getting stopped and robbed. We speak Spanish and he was informing us this, however at no point during the duration of our trip did we feel unsafe.

ATM: There are two ATMs right before the airport exit where the taxis are. We took out cash here to be able to pay the taxi.

Transportation: We used Uber primarily. On a couple of occasions we used the train and Metrocable. They charge a one time fee for the card, so we paid at the kiosk and explained where we were going and needed a round trip for two people and it was easy to use. We had downloaded the train map with the different lines and that was very helpful.

Accommodations: We stayed in El Poblado and it was walking distance to Provenza. 

Tipping: At tourist restaurants they will ask you if you want to include service. I said yes and it was a set percentage as tip. For tours the guide will state that tipping is optional. For free walking tours the website usually has information on how much tipping is expected per person. If you know Spanish, I highly recommend the Spanish tours. 

Things to know: 

1. If there is a holiday, they will do maintenance on certain public transportation lines the day after the holiday. We tried to go to Parque Arvi after Dia de la Raza and one of the lines was closed.

2. Pablo Escobar is a sensitive subject. I was already aware of this. We had not watched the series or movie or what not, but we wanted to go to the museum. We assumed it was a government museum where it was going to speak about all the casualties etc. However, when our Uber was taking us to the museum, he passed it and then we asked him why he had passed the location/museum. He stated that one had been closed and was taking us to the current one. We were dropped off and the place did not look like a museum, it said ""Artesanias"" the uber was still waiting so we walked in. They stated it was a museum and I asked if the other one had been closed and they stated this is the original one and the other two are copies. We paid and during the tour they stated at the end we would be able to take a picture with Pablo Escobars brother. We were definately unaware he was alive and that he was there. During the tour we gathered that this museum is run by his family and they were trying to deny some things that the government stated. Afterwards, we looked online and it seems one museum was closed that was ran by the family, however the original museum we were trying to go to was still open. We are still unsure as to how we were dropped off at the location and not at the original location. I mean everyone was nice, but it was a little suspicious.

1gr1co6,What places is Bali similar to?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gr1co6/what_places_is_bali_similar_to/,18,"I'm considering a solo trip, but I'm not sure if I'm clutching at straws. It would be 3 days in Singapore and 6 days in Bali.

I should point out that this is looking to be mid/end of March 2025. I've seen that it's not the greatest time, but is it really that bad?

I love cities like Tokyo, Osaka, Taipei, Bangkok and Seoul. I've been to Kathmandu, Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. Koh Samui, Vientiane, Hanoi. I enjoyed them and I get the feeling that those are similar to Bali?

I like a quite structured plan when travelling, I'm not really a fan of ""go get an unmarked bus from a random corner, that departs whenever it's full"". I'm also not really a ""go with the flow"" person, who just turns up without a plan in mind and decides at the time. Bali seems a little chaotic in that way, a bit like the Hippy Trail vibe.

So before I jumped straight in, I wanted opinions. Is it similar to the places I listed, or is it more of an overwhelming experience, sort of like I hear India can be.

Thanks in advance, I hope my question isn't too vague!",52,2024-11-14 03:49:23,csgw84,0.68

And since we all were looking into it together (4 different people, from 4 different devices), this can't really be an illusion?

I am really hopeful I can get this resolved.

1gegg18,Here‚Äôs how much I spent on an 8 day roadtrip,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gegg18/heres_how_much_i_spent_on_an_8_day_roadtrip/,16,"Here‚Äôs how much I spent on an 8 day roadtrip through Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. You can use this to help plan the cost for your trip, please note your trips cost will vary depending on what you do. 

Gas $210
Tolls/parking fee $7
Excursion $21
Eating out $32
Grocery‚Äôs $112
Showers $16
Wear n tear on car (estimated) $75

Total: $473, or about $59 a day.

How I kept my costs low

Accommodations. I downloaded the iOverlander app and wild camped. For those who have never wild camped before it‚Äôs basically a flat place to park in the woods. No running water, bathrooms, or trash service. I used the bathroom at places while I was out doing activities like visitor centers, gas stations etc. I showered at campgrounds and gyms, these cost $2-$7.

I made most of my meals. The meals I had on this trip were pasta and meatballs, meatball sub, sandwiches, rice and beans, and canned soups. I ate out twice getting a fried fish basket in Michigan‚Äôs UP as well as a pastie (similar to a chicken pot pie, pronounced pass-tee). 

Activities. To keep myself busy I brought a book to read at night and during the day I did hiking, kayaking, and saw points of interest that were free such as viewing Michigan‚Äôs lighthouses. For the hiking and kayaking I stayed in national forests, National lakeshores, and national parks. I got free admission with a 2024 national pass I was gifted.  I did pay for one excision which was a Historical ghost tour in Minneapolis.

I ended up spending $210 on gas, I drove 2,150 miles and got 29 MPG. I estimated spending $243 on gas, the way I estimated the price of gas is add the total miles I expect to drive divided by MPG I expect to get to give me gallons burned. I then take the average cost of a gallon of gas in each state divided by how many states I‚Äôll be getting gas in. Then multiple that average gas per gallon multiplied by how many gallons I expect to burn. Example of this equation I used for this trip.

2,250 estimated miles / 29 mpg ‚Äé‚Äâ=‚Äâ78 gallons of gas

$3.12 Average cost per gallon of gas X 78 gallons = $243 estimated spend on gas.

For estimating the wear n tear on my car I put in my cars make and model into chatgbt and asked it to estimate wear in tear for driving 2,150 miles and not include resale devaluation since I plan to run my car until it gives out. Wear and tear would be things such as oil, tire wear, cabin/engine air filter replacement, break pad wear, various fluids being used. The $75 is not a perfect estimate but close enough for me.

Obviously, this is just one employee at the airport telling me this, so might not be true. But there was quite a number of people directed to the same employee as me, all with ESTA issues.

My field is one where I'd be surprised if I didn't have a job in a month or two, so I'm trying to make the most of it, so don't worry about that.

A lot of the last minute websites are actually just showing things that are 30-90 days out, but I'm wondering if there's anywhere that will show me if there's a 3-day cruise or vacation package that leaves tomorrow, or at least sometime this week, and will be a lot cheaper. I do a decent amount of churning (lots of Chase points), so domestic US flights are relatively cheap through United, and my city is a Delta/Frontier focus city, so lots of options there too.

Ideally, I'd like to stay fairly budget-friendly of a few hundred bucks, but I'm just itching to go somewhere. I figure cruises may be the best deal when it comes to this, but I'm open to all options. I will be traveling by myself, and I live in SW Ohio for driving options.

1gdx1ct,"Locations to swim in calm, clean, safe, warm water during Jan-March.",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gdx1ct/locations_to_swim_in_calm_clean_safe_warm_water/,15,"I'm researching the best places to snowbird for 1-3 months during Jan-Mar. Main purpose is for casual swimming almost every day.

Would appreciate suggestions.

Background:

68 yo male, living in Leland, North Carolina, USA. Reasonably fit. Have swam all my life in lakes, oceans, and rivers in the USA on both coasts. Swimming has especially become my favorite pastime now that my joints are getting older, though no longer comfortable getting knocked around by waves and chop. Have been to the Philippines and Singapore many years ago.

Musts:

* Water calm most of the time, 76F (25C) or higher, low pathogens. Low probability of boxer jellyfish or other significant water hazards. Low currents.
* Accommodations that are within 15 minute walk to the beach and from restaurants/street food, and 30 min walk to grocery stores. Or convenient/inexpensive taxi/shuttle service. I don't plan to rent a car.
* Some locals, tourist staff, police, medical, speak enough English to accommodate English-speaking visitors.
* Low probability of robberies.
* Easy living. I'm getting older and doing this to relax and swim.

Strong want:

* Cost limit of $3,000/month USD, all in, including travel.
* Don't plan to rent a car.

Preferences, though willing to give on these. (In fact the last 2 conflict.)

* Lower travel time is better.
* Lower total cost is better.
* Asian-style food (love it). Reasonable availability of vegetables. (Healthy eater but not a vegetarian.)
* If not English, then Spanish is the national language. (Easiest for me to learn, and useful in the USA as well.)

No need for:

* Alcoholic beverages
* Touristy attractions, shops, sight seeing.

Here's my thoughts so far just from YouTube, Google maps, Airbnb, Rome2Rio. Feel free to correct any wrong assumptions or point me in a good direction.

Southeast Asia is tempting for low cost of living and Asian food, once I get there. Would scale well to more months per year, visas allowing. Major downside is flights are 35 to 48 hours!, and $1,200 to 1,800 USD. Maybe layover a couple nights somewhere to break up the travel. At that level of investment I'd want to stay 2 months this first time. Would be terrible if I arrived and the water/beach wasn't as expected. Seems risky. Cenang beach, Langkawi Island, Malaysia is first pick so far. Other possibilities are Thailand and Philippines. Choosing Langkawi for it being 60% English speaking, less crowded than Thailand, pretty clean and modern, low crime, constitutional government, automatic visa exception for 90 days. Doesn't seem to be as high quality lodging for the dollar as Thailand. Google AI overview says jelly fish season is Jan to July but [https://www.langkawi.com/langkawi-travel-tips/](https://www.langkawi.com/langkawi-travel-tips/) says  May - October. I'll have to check r/Malaysia about that.

Vietnam is out as most of the coast is east facing and breeze is westerly during Jan - Mar.¬†

Mexico is a short flight. Water temp is borderline though. Areas around Puerta Vallarta and Yucatan might work. Water isn't always calm.

¬†I wanted to like Central America or Caribbean Islands. Seems like I'd need to rent a car to get around though. That would be $1000+/month USD right there. Maybe I could find a location where I could take a bus or shuttle from airport to a small town on the coast that would support the need for food and lodging. Rome2Rio helps, but I'm finding this transportation part difficult to plan. Would be nervous to navigate busses without knowing the language. Also some concerns about crime.

¬†Looked into Columbia. Best pick so far Santa Marta. Doesn't seem ideal for beaches. Still seeing reports within the past year of robberies on the street after dark.

Wondering about travel agents and packages. I haven't found anything good on that yet.

Thanks for any ideas. While traveling to Southeast Asia seems exciting, even better would be a location with lower investment in travel and stay about a month this first time, if it would meet my criteria.",22,2024-10-28 03:21:53,GoTellIt33,0.76

1gp6n4p,Two weeks in India for a first-timer: What's your best set of itinerary priorities (aka the must-sees)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gp6n4p/two_weeks_in_india_for_a_firsttimer_whats_your/,12,"Hi gang. My wife and I are veteran travelers, but we've never been to India. Targeting about this time next year (Nov. 2025). We're just now getting our arms around the various ""standard tour"" itineraries out there for classic northern India destinations and sites, and it's hard to get a handle on the best way to apportion 14-ish nights there... and who to plan it with.

Background Info:  Active &amp; healthy 60 year-old Americans. Leaning into luxury-tier, but not necessarily f.u. money.

We usually do independent planning ourselves, but looking for guided options &amp; small-party tours this time around. Third-party planning and on-site logistics, start to finish.

We've briefly looked into the usual upmarket tour operators (NatGeo, Tauck, Odysseys Unlimited, etc.), but  their itineraries differ and none appears to hit ALL the top sites... which would be overkill for two weeks anyway.

So Agra is a 100% must, and I think Udaipur, Jodhupur, Jaipur, and Varanasi are too. Should we just stop there? For reference, we're there primarily for the cultural sites and experiences -- not safaris, tiger preserves, or other wildlife adventures.

Your thoughts are greatly appreciated!

* By selecting EURO, Paypal is supposed to charge the EURO amount to my bank -- my bank would be the one to do the conversion to CAD.
* Saw absurdly high CAD amounts on my bank statements for some of the EURO transactions. My credit card / bank is the Wealthsimple Cash Card, which does not charge any FX conversion fees. 
* Looked into my Paypal transaction history. For the absurdly high transactions, I noticed that Paypal would convert the CAD amount -- before charging that **CAD amount** to my bank/credit card. So, Paypal was actually doing the conversion to CAD, even though I select EURO.  Anyone know why?

  
Note: The vendor in this example is [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), and I checked those details too -- they were charging me in the local foreign currency (EURO), so, there is no conversion being done by the vendor/booking.com.

1gsa5s9,"Amazing time in the middle east (Gulf states - Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait)",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gsa5s9/amazing_time_in_the_middle_east_gulf_states_saudi/,12,"Spent \~10 days in Gulf states at the end of October - was in Saudi Arabia (5 days), Oman (3 days), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait (1 day each).  I got a lot of weird looks from friends, family, coworkers when I said I'm going to these places, so I wanted to share my experience and break some of the misconceptions

General thoughts / observations:

* **Very safe** \- I had no issues walking around late into the evening on my own, while having my phone &amp; camera out. I also saw a lot of women walking on their own at night, esp in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait.  Americans tend to have the perception that much of the middle east is strife with terrorism risks, and I'd say with exception of borders areas w/ Yemen (a very small part of Saudi &amp; Oman), the GCC countries are all super safe.  
* **Amazingly friendly &amp; helpful locals** \- I was solo but happened to make friends at each stop.  Highlight was in Oman where I was invited to BBQ with a group of local guys after a hike!  My phone also died one night while driving, and a local offered to help me navigate to my hotel as he drove and I followed for a good 15 minutes.  I had a few folks ask me to take pictures of them on my DSLR, and then each time that evolved into meals / drinks / long chats afterwards!   While I studied Arabic for a few weeks, almost everyone spoke some basic English (esp in cities), so I never had issues with language barrier.  That said, a few arabic words go a long way to get a smile from people!
* **Driving in the cities is harder than expected but doable** \-  Amazing road quality - Google Maps and Waze both worked well.  I only tried drive in Doha, and it wasn't easy - lanes are fluid, people don't like to ""let you"" change lanes, more aggressive tailgating, and there are a LOT of red light + speeding cameras, some speed signs only had arabic #s.  Speed limits are true limits (not like in the US freeways where you can drive 75 mph on a 65 limit), and yellow lights are very short, with expensive red light tix (like $1000).  I also drove in rural Oman and rural Saudi Arabia - that was super easy as there were few cars.  I wouldn't recommend driving in Riyadh for beginners. 
* **Come in the winter** \- days were still hot esp outdoors, I think December-Mar would be best, but the heat was manageable most days, and it was nice to have fewer crowd. Places are also open much later because people really come out after the sun sets given the heat.  A lot of places I visited were completely empty in the day time (esp between 12-4pm), and then completely gets packed in the evening! 
* **Respect the local custom / culture** \- GCC states are still relatively conservative.  So for all visitors I'd encourage you to wear pants.  Women should also have their shoulders covered and avoid super tight clothing (including yoga pants), but I don't think your hair needs to be covered outside of visiting mosques.  In terms of conservatism, Saudi &gt; Oman &gt; Qatar &gt; Bahrain &gt; Kuwait.  Oman is the most touristy tho, so I saw visitors wearing shorts, women with exposed shoulders, etc, but I think it was disrespectful.  PDA is also frowned upon, and outside of Kuwait, I pretty much never saw a man and woman holding hands/arms.

**Saudi Arabia** \- I visited Riyadh, Jeddah, and AlUla.  Saudi was the most conservative of the countries I visited, but still surprisingly more open than I expected.  In AlUla (mostly catering to westerners) - resort pools were mixed, bikini okay, I even saw a LGBT couple (though I wouldn't recommend coming to Saudi yet for LGBT+ community).  Jeddah is more liberal than Saudi. Plenty of women now drive on their own, walk around on their own / with other women.  I saw more women without hijabs in Jeddah, and even had local women approach me.  As a guy tho, I would only approach other men for questions, directions, etc. 

* **AlUla** was an A+ experience. It's home to the ancient Nabatean people (same as Petra) - there's a smaller version of Petra called Hegra but without the crowd.  5\* resorts were excellent. Beautiful landscape - like Sahara Desert meets Utah.  Old town was being renovated so should look amazing but still historical in the next year.  
* **Jeddah** is a beautiful seaside town, and very multicultural.  Old Jeddah is really pretty at night, and a lot of people were out and about shopping, walking.  Highlight was the TeamLab art ""museum"" (mostly a thing in Japan I believe, but it was fun!).  
* **Riyadh** I actually didn't love as much. City is very sprawled and there's 3-4 pockets of tourist attractions, so I spent my two days mostly in cars stuck in traffic.  Highlight was the Diriyah old town. I missed out on Boulevard City b/c traffic was so bad. The subway system with like 70+ stops is all suppose to open in a few months, which will be game changer I think.  

**Bahrain** \- it's a very small country but honestly a heavy hitter in terms of history / archaeology!  Highlight was the Bahrain Fort, which documents \~4000 years of evolving habitation, and the museum attached to the site was A+. Bahrain was also the heart of the Dilmun civilization, 

**Qatar** \- I was mostly in Doha, which is the most modern city of all the places I visited.  It's also probably the cleanest city as well, though every GCC city I visited was generally clean. Felt the most like Dubai, but even newer.  Also the most expensive.   Qatar National Museum was excellent and the Islamic Art Museum was very comprehensive and beautiful, and you get a gorgeous shot of Doha skyline in the courtyard. 

**Kuwait** \- I pretty quickly ran out of things to do in Kuwait, but I ran into a group of Kuwaiti teenagers who decided to adopt me and drive me around the city to hang out, so that was really the highlight haha. Besides that, the old market was HUGE.  It also felt like the most walkable of the cities I visited. 

**Oman** \- I split my time in Muscat and in the mountains just south of Muscat.  Highlight in Muscat was the Sultan Qaboos Mosque - breathtaking spot. Tho I recommend to go at opening, b/c it gets packed with tourists, and influencers who will aggressively pose and push people out of the way, which I thought was rude.  I had a blast in the mountains. There's a few historical towns (Nizwa, Bahla) - each has a large fort and market.  Nizwa also had a cool goat market on Fri morning.  I also visited a few small mountain villages which were very quaint.  Reminded me of time in the Atlas Mountains in Morocco.  Highlight was visiting a local wadi (river canyon) for a swim and then hanging out with a group of locals for tea &amp; BBQ.

I would also LOVE any recommendations about attractions, events, activities or food for any of the above cities!

I'm feeling stuck on where to go, and could use some advice. 

Initially I really wanted to go to Edinburgh, but since the time change, I've been worried that Edinburgh this month might just be depressing. 

I'll be with my partner, and we love museums, history, architecture, books, great food, light hiking, and tea. We have to end in London, but can start in either London or Edinburgh. We're seeking an active trip, but not a hectic one. I've been to the UK several times before, but my partner's never been. 

The two itinerary options I've been considering are:

3 days Edinburgh &gt; train south &gt; rent a car and spend 2 days in Lake District or Yorkshire Dales &gt; train to London &gt; 3 days London. 

2 days London &gt; rent car and spend 4 days road tripping through the Cotswolds + Peak District &gt; 2 days London. 

I think I'm struggling with this so much because I've never been to the UK in the fall before, and it's just been so much chillier and darker than I expected. ",23,2024-10-31 16:31:22,readyeager,0.86

1gd0k0e,Taj Mahal Trip Journey Summer 2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gd0k0e/taj_mahal_trip_journey_summer_2024/,10,"Never posted my visit to the Taj Mahal and thought it was worth explaining how I did it since I didn't use a guide.

We first landed in Delhi and took the metro (pretty clean and modern) from the airport to the H NIZAMUDDIN station in New Delhi. Now this station is pretty terrible, there's no AC and all the inside waiting rooms are packed full of people which means you are waiting in the stifling Delhi heat. I suggest only getting there 20 - 30 min early to avoid this. We were taking the VANDE BHARAT EXP train (India's high speed which you can book online) from New Delhi to Agra (2 hours roughly). Now the train itself has 2 options: EC and CC. You can consider EC to be like an Amtrak style seating with big seats and in pairs while CC is more like planes with seats in 3. Both are air conditioned and good enough for a 2 hour journey. EC was around 15 USD per person while CC was around 8 USD so not a huge difference.

The worst part of the entire trip is definitely the AGRA CANTT railway station. The second you get off there will be people ready to scam you, sell you tours, get in there taxi, etc. They will try and hustle you in every point and often they look like authority figures so just keep walking to the exit. This is where I suggest having an Uber ready and pre-ordered as an auto or a taxi will do there best to upcharge you.

The actual city itself is fine, we stayed at a hotel on the Agra-Bah road which is the main thoroughfare in Agra. It's also connected to the Metro which was recently built and modern (no true need to use the metro considering how cheap Ubers and autos are there).

Getting to the Taj Mahal: The Taj Mahal is open 30 minutes BEFORE sunrise. There is no set time of 6am or anything like that, they are open 30 minutes before sunrise and I highly suggest getting there early as you do have to walk. It really does look beautiful in the morning light and as it changes to afternoon light it only gets better. Try and take an Uber from your hotel as autos and taxis will charge you an insane sum as they know every one is trying to get there in the morning. I also suggest going to the Taj Mahal East Gate which is less touristy and has a smaller wait line. You can buy your tickets at the gate or you can purchase online which I highly suggest you do (15 USD for foreigners).

The Taj Mahal is beautiful as you walk through the gates and get to see all the sights along with the banks of the Yamuna River. There will be people around the entrance selling themselves as guides or offering to take pictures for a fee just a FYI. I suggest staying, walking around, and just relaxing for some time as you see the differences in morning vs afternoon light. You can also pay extra to see inside the Taj Mahal which I recommend even though there's not much to actually see.

The Agra fort is another place that's definitely worth seeing. It's about 10 USD for foreigners and its a quick uber or metro ride from the Taj Mahal. It's another well manicured place with mosaics, artistry, and it offers another great viewpoint of the Taj Mahal.

Overall, the trip was pretty enjoyable and I think its definitely doable without a guide especially since a lot of people in India speak a decent amount of English and there is a lot more tourist guidance.

I can book tickets for 1500 dollars (per person) that includes plane tickets and 4* hotel in Times Square.

None of us parties or drinks alcohol. So expensive club/party trips are not planned. 

Our plan is to travel and see the different things the city can offer, eat good food, try different things and yeah just to experience a part of the USA for the first time.

I was guessing that we would spend 1000-1500 Danish crown (DKK) per day which is about 150-210 dollars a day. This is around 2100-2900 dollars for a 14-day trip.

So my question for the experienced travelers is: is a 3600-4400 dollars trip realistic for a 14-day trip in New York including everything?

Again, none of us parties or drinks alcohol. So I guess we will save a lot of money from that. ",97,2024-11-16 09:26:17,MrWorldwideFB,0.65

I'm not sure what to do from here. I tried calling their U.S. number last week after the three days had passed and didn't get a human. I assume that the link is to download the visa, since it has my name in itn(maybe I'm wrong), but it won't open in Chrome or Edge, not on laptop or mobile.

I'm posting this as I often use reddit for travel research and feel I should give back. The shirt version though is that it is Rapa Nui is definitely worth it IMO.

Key details
- 6 days, 5 nights
- Couple - one waiting 20 years to go and another just happy to be there. 
- total cost incl flights, tours, park tickets, food accommodation &amp; airprot taxis to and from Santiago airport - $1,658 or $829 pp.
- Flights $652 return for both $326 each booked two months before departure. 

Planning/research
Mostly reddit trip reports, guide geek GPT, and reviews online

Tour Company
Hahave tours - 2/5 stars would suggest you take a risk with another company or at least book some with another company. 

Pros: budget friendly, all tours took place and most, though not all, of the staff are nice.

Cons: very poor on communication and details. 

We asked for an outline of tours several times but did not get it. This had a materially negative impact on several yours. E.g. did not inform us that one tour ended with a two hour beach stop, which led to us waiting to go for 2 hours to go home rather than enjoying the beach as we didn't have towels/shorts etc. It's still nice but could have been much better. 

Did not offer information on what to bring, etc. 

Told us to be outside for 05.40 to be collected for sunrise. Did not arrive until 06.25, no apology or acknowledgement of lateness, and did not provide us with information until we sought it from them when they were 20 minutes late. 

Overall, I would not recommend it to a friend. 

5 tours we did were:

1. Show artistic ballet - enjoyable but ultimately unnecessary. They didn't explain what it was, and it kinda felt like a tourist trap experience, though their may have been more to it.  2/5
2. Full day Hopu Manu - the guide was hard to understand, which made the tour difficult to follow. 3/5
3. Amanacer ahu tongariki(sunrise) - this was cool, but our experience in the lead up kinda burned it a bit 3/5
4. Full day Moai Henua - aamzing. Same guide as for Tour 2 but had visual aids and was way way better. 5/5 highlight of the trip.
5. Trekking cavernas - cool but poorly explained, probably not needed. 3/5. 

I had been waiting years to come here and often found myself filling in details for my partner, but honestly, it was tough to follow even if you sometimes knew what was coming. 

Accommodation
Pua Vaenga (Would recommend) - $247.50 for 5 nights. Private room shared bathroom. Collected at and dropped off to the airport included. 
 
Pros: cheap, excellent staff, good facilities. Nice atmosphere. Family owned, and they are very nice. Nice common area.

Cons: not the cleanest and a 30-minute walk from town. But it's still worth it.

Food
Combination of grocery shopping and restaurants. I found the food in restaurants very good. Groceries were more expensive than the mainland but mostly okay. We could not find chicken in stores, though. 

The tap water tastes very odd. Only place I've been where I couldn't drink it. Bottled and filtered water everywhere, though, so it's not an issue (though bottled water is expensive) 

Was pleasantly surprised by the wine selection (I know Chile is wine country. I just didn't expect it to make it that far). 

Overall

It's an incredible place, and despite the tour company, just being there really carries. You feel so tiny surrounded by water with no other population for 2000 km. And the the history and heads are just enthralling. It's absolutely worth it, but you could do it for less money and in a shorter time frame.

If you are stuck, you could very much get away with tours 2 and 4 above and still feel like you did what needed to be done. That being said, I am definitely glad we stayed longer and took it slower.",11,2024-10-27 16:42:39,CrushableStetson,0.91

- I've dropped Khiva to add more days in Dushanbe, is that going to be a huge miss or should I lessen my time in any of the cities to include Khiva?
- I'm planning to cross the Uzbek-Tajik ""Jartepa"" border, and planning to fly out to Tashkent on my way back. Are there anything I should be aware of doing this route?
- Since I'm travelling late December, I would be in Uzbekistan, ideally Bukhara or Samarkand for Christmas. Is Christmas celebrations non-existent in Uzbekistan or is there anything I can find during the time?

It was a great way to see a lot of spectacular natural locations, in company with other fans of the books and movies.

Five years ago, we did a Smithsonian Tour that had an emphasis on learning about castles in Scotland.  That was good, but nowhere near the fabulousness of the NZ tour.

We want to find another tour like the NZ one, but searching for such a thing is not turning up any strong leads.  I've searched for geek/nerd tours, tours for a few other movies/books we like, and so on, but no luck.

The things that made the NZ tour especially good were:  
\- everyone on the tour was very interested in the books and locations.  The Scotland tour had a number of people who didn't seem all that invested in it.  
\- the tour guides were locals, really knew their material, and were longtime fans of the books/movies (Scotland tour had two local professors, and two Smithsonian guides not from the area.)  
\- as a result of the first two, we (two geeky and introverted people) felt we were not amongst strangers, even though the other attendees were from all over the world.  
\- the itinerary was a good mix of impressive sites/sights, side adventures (like a helicopter landing high up in a mountain range that was one movie site, and another that was a Maori cultural evening), time spent with NZ craftspeople that were involved in the films (landowners/extras, calligrapher, jeweler, WETA) and time in cities and towns. We felt we had a decent overview of NZ as a country, not just as a movie set.

So you see, these things are kind of unusual, and I don't know how to find something similar -- assuming something similar even exists.  It wouldn't need to be a tour focused on a movie or book.. or author, if it had these characteristics. I don't know if there are industry terms for any of this that I could use for a keyword search.  I'm hoping people will have some ideas.

And, because I'm sure it will come up: yes, we want a guided/organized tour.  We also go abroad on our own, but one of us has a day job essentially herding cats, and to NOT be the one in charge is a true vacation.",20,2024-11-12 21:59:48,redmeanshelp,0.75

I enjoy nightlife too but that's not as important on this trip for me, although I'd like to go out for New Years.

1. Am I giving myself enough time at Machu Picchu? I've tried to account for the time it takes to get from the station to the site, but wondering if I should get an earlier train &amp; entry.
2. How easy is it to get a Sacred Valley tour from Ollantaytambo? Almost all of the ones I'm finding online leave from/end in Cusco.
3. Is Humantay Lake worth it/better than Rainbow mountain if I have to choose?


Itinerary:

Day 1: Arrive in Lima late evening, stay at hotel

Day 2: Spend the day exploring Lima. Late evening flight to Cusco.

Day 3: Cusco day 1 - Get acclimated and explore Cusco. Potentially will take a city walking tour if the altitude sickness isn‚Äôt getting to me

Day 4: Cusco day 2 - Inca temple horseback riding tour (half-day)

Day 5: Cusco day 3 - Either Red Valley &amp; Rainbow Mountain tour OR Humantay Lake day trip (need help deciding)

Day 6: Cusco day 4 - Rest day/New Years Day. Will probably do a cooking class/food market tour or something else low-key.

Day 7: Ollantaytambo day 1 - Taxi from Cusco to Ollantaytambo, try to get to Ollantaytambo by early afternoon. Settle in and explore the town.

Day 8: Ollantaytambo day 2 - Sacred Valley day tour

Day 9: Machu Picchu/Ollantaytambo day 3 - All-day trip to Machu Picchu. Morning train to Aguas Calientes arriving at 9:50a for an 11a entry to Machu Picchu. Train back from AC to Ollantaytambo leaving at 4:45p. 

Day 10: Travel day back to Lima - Hang out in Ollantaytambo in the morning, take taxi back to Cusco around noon for 5p flight from Cusco to Lima. Go out to a neighborhood in Lima if I'm feeling up for it.

Day 11 (1/6): Huacachina day tour from Lima.

Day 12 (1/7): Fly home early morning from Lima.

Day 1
We flew in to Taoyuan Airport then took the express train to Taipei station then took the bus from Âè∞ÂåóËΩâÈÅãÁ´ô. The bus leaves every half hour and the journey was about an hour to Jiaoxi. 
We left our luggage at the hotel then went and had some ÂÜ¨Á≤â, which I do recommend since they have good broth.
We then went to the Kavalan Distillery and ended the day at Luodong nightmarket.
The market has ok food but it‚Äôs is smaller than the ones in Taipei.

Day 2
We booked a boat trip experience to Turtle Island on Klook. The sea was too choppy so we weren‚Äôt able to land on the island but we were able to see so many dolphins. If you hadn‚Äôt done similar experience then I do recommend it.
For lunch we had some ramen which was ok.
In the afternoon we went to the National Center of National Art, which had some nice shops but I think the experience will only be worth it if you do some of their DIY stuff which we didn‚Äôt.
For dinner we went to Á©∫„ÑüËæ≤Â†¥ which has decent food and nice view. They have a pickup point at the bottom of the hill which is the only way up.

Day 3
We booked a taxi for the day for heading to TaiPingShan which I found on the net and was much cheaper than klook or kkday.
It was drizzling so it was a bit hazy but it was still an enjoyable experience.

I will be in santo domingo, then i will go to puerto plata (paseo de do√±a blanco and 27 charcos de damajagua), then Jamao Al Norte to do Rio Partido (found a tour for this but the tour forces me to get 2 tickete even though I am one person), then Bayahib (or maybe santo domingo again) for corazon de bayahib.
For car, can I rent from airport or is it to my benefit to rent on apps like cheapoair, expedia, etc

1gb5i1z,South America vs SEA,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gb5i1z/south_america_vs_sea/,6,"Hi everyone! First post ever here. I'm currently almost done graduating and early next year I'd love to take a few months to travel before I start working. My plan is to travel from late February-March (still flexible) until the end of June (so 3-4 months), with my budget being around ‚Ç¨6000 (including flights). I really like hiking, photography, discovering local cuisines,  and history.  
  
Currently I am trying to decide if I should go to either South America or Southeast Asia. I have done a lot of traveling in my life, also did an exchange year but I have never actually backpacked, so this would be my first time! I have visited Asia before (Indonesia, Singapore and Sri Lanka), but never been to South America, which is also why I'd love to go there. 

For South America I'd love to visit  Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, perhaps with a stop in Ecuador. I have heard that Ecuador currently is not really safe at the moment, but I'd be happy to hear if the opposite is true. South America seems super adventurous and varied, although also a bit less safe and more expensive than SEA. However places like Macchu Picchu, Salar de Uyuni, the hiking in Peru, and the jungles of Colombia are very much on my bucketlist. I also thought ending the trip by taking a boat from Cartagena to the San Blas islands in Panama and flying back home from there.

In Southeast Asia I'd want to visit Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and I was also thinking about either going to Malaysia, Taiwan, or Nepal from there after finishing the standard Banana Pancake trail. In Thailand I'd also like to learn how to scuba dive and maybe do some surfing. The culture, food, and nature here seem really awesome too, although nature seems a bit less varied than in South America.

All in all both seem like good options, with my preference at the moment being South America. However, I'm not sure if my budget will fit, I've seen a lot of different things online on living costs, so I'd be happy to hear opinions from people who have been there and if it is realistic to travel on 6000 euros for about 3 months. Otherwise I'll start looking into SEA where I think money goes a bit further.  Also not sure where the weather will be better for traveling during that time of year. Any and all tips are really welcome! : ) ",9,2024-10-24 10:34:28,EngineerMushroom,0.69

Berlin (6 nights)

Prague (4 nights)

Budapest (4 nights) 

Vienna (4 nights)

Munich (6 nights)

The reason I'm staying so long in Berlin is because I really consider living there in the near future, so I really want to get to know the city a bit more. Also out of the 5 full days in staying in Berlin, I want to spend the day in two out of the three cities of Dresden, Leipzig or Hamburg. I know Hamburg is very far, but idk still thinking about it.

In Munich, I really I'm looking for advices, I was planning to take 3-4 days to visit Neuschwanstein, Zugspitze, Innsbruck and maybe Salzburg. Some people said that I might like it better to go to Berchtesgaden instead of Zugspitze, any ideas?

I'm also accepting tips for about my itinerary and nice places to see and visit throughout the trip.

1gmod3d,I want to take a sabbatical - where do I start?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gmod3d/i_want_to_take_a_sabbatical_where_do_i_start/,6,"Hello Reddit,

I am burnt out. I am almost 30. I need a short career break and some new perspective/experiences.

I have been toying with this idea for some time now and it's been encapsulating my mind more and more over the months. I am single, with no kids, no pets. The only main responsibility I have is to take care of my mortgage of a home I bought a year ago. It's very unlikely that will be an issue because it is a place I can rent out to cover the mortgage expenses. I certainly won't make a profit but I can just about break even on it.

  
In terms of financial side of things, I have about ¬£15,000 savings. I don't intend to eat into all of the money as I must have enough to cover for emergency purposes (especially if I become a landlord). My best option is travel as economically as possible, and am leaning towards arrangements where I can work/volunteer in exchange for a place to stay (with food is a big plus). I've heard from people that this is possible but I need to some guidance on how to find these opportunities. Do these arrangements need a lot of notice? I've seen Workaway as an example but not sure if it's a trusted source.

I also want to be able to have an option to travel on a budget without paying extortionate prices for flights. If its means trains, buses, car etc, i'm open to these things.

I'm open to any destination. Travelling through South America for example is a very appealing idea for me. 

I'd like the journey to last months, even up to 12 months. I may even consider a 6 month rent contract for my place and put it on month-to-month rolling.

I need inspiration and any advice on how to start this would be greatly appreciated!

We traveled exclusively by train, bus, etc (no cars).

Wins: 

- We opted to leave the travel stroller at home, and I'm so glad we did. So many more stairs than I remember! A stroller would have been a total PITA.

- A small backpack for the 4YO full of activities (coloring, stickers, cards, games). He refused to carry it, but loved being able to do activities on trains/planes.

- 40L thule Aion: I (38 YO) was able to easily carry all my own stuff on my back, freeing my hands to pull a small rollerboard for the kiddo while holding his hand.

- I convinced Grandma to downsize to a smaller rollerboard (just a smidge larger than under seat) which made it possible for her to manage her own bags without help. 

- Toddler wore keen sneakers, which he loved. Grandma wore chaco lace up boots, also a hit. I wore leather Taos sneakers. All of us were fine with just one pair of shoes.

- Absolutely did not need a car seat for this trip. Public transport was plentiful and easy. Kids are free until 4 in France and 6 in Germany/Switzerland, too.

- We were able to be cash free almost the entire trip, but the kiddo wanted to see the miniature coin operated train at the station run. Using the little cash we did take out was fairly simple, but could have just used cards.

Losses

- Both my mom and I brought a small backpack as our personal item. We would have had an easier time with a small zippered tote (basically landscape rather than portrait orientation). I couldn't wear my backpack because I was already wearing the Thule big backpack (so I wish I had crossbody or shoulder straps). Mom lost one of the kiddo's stuffies on the first day of the trip, because her backpack came open without her realizing it.

- I carried extra shoes for the 4YO for no reason.

- A bag with spare undies in an outside bag pocket would have been a smart move.

- Lighter more packable jackets would have made life easier, especially because it turned out to be warmer than expected. Our jackets were right for only about 2 of 10 days. I carried an extra sweatshirt for the kiddo that he never wore.

- I wish I would have planned the cost of public transport a little more thoughtfully. I wonder if I could have booked day passes or other travel passes instead of point to point. I don't think we overpaid too much here, but probably a little. 

- We had one longer train ride using Deutschebahn that was booked as spar preis, but they changed the schedule about two weeks before our trip, forcing a need to rebook. I attempted to rebook from the US, but wasn't able to. It was easily corrected at the train station, and I wish I hadn't even tried to bother with it from home. 

I would do this trip again and would recommend with any amenable preschoolers.",0,2024-11-06 05:54:27,thirdcoastmama,0.65

1ghdbxa,Italy Trip ‚Äì Mid November!,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ghdbxa/italy_trip_mid_november/,7,"Hi! 

My partner and I are planning a last minute, 2 week trip to Italy from Nov 12-Nov 25. Would love any thoughts on our itinerary below! We currently have flights in and out of Rome, but nothing else is booked yet, we're open to anything and everything. Mid-range budget.   
  
Our travel style: We'd love to have a trip that includes a mix of city travel and relaxing moments in smaller villages. We don't need to check every standard tourist item off the list (no doubt that would be worthwhile too!) but we'd prefer to spend many afternoons wandering side streets, getting lost, grabbing a bite to eat along the river, checking out local vintage shops, etc. (Of course we are planning to include some museums, churches, the Colosseum, we just won't necessarily organize the full trip around those things). We'd especially love to include things that feel a little different from what you'd usually expect to hit in Italy (hence the castle idea, farmhouse stay, hot springs). 

1. 11/12- travel overnight
2. 11/13 - Arrive Rome in the afternoon (bit of a wash due to jetlag)
3. 11/14- Full Day Rome
4. 11/15 - Full Day Rome (3 total nights in Rome, thinking of staying in city center or Trastavere)
5. 11/16 - Rome to Bologna in the morning (train)
6. 11/17 - Bologna 
7. 11/18 - Bologna to Florence (train)
8. 11/19 - Florence
9. 11/20 - Full day in Florence 
10. 11/21- Rent car, Florence to Tuscany (start in Siena)
11. 11/22 -Tuscany
12. 11/23 - Tuscany (thinking of hitting Montepulciano, Montalcino, maybe Assisi, Orvieto...wide open here!)
13. 11/24 - Spello day for olive oil festival, drive back to Rome 
14. 11/25 - Fly home in the morning

We are open to any ideas! A couple of other ideas we have, weather pending:  
‚Ä¢ Cinque Terre day trip (during one of the Florence days) ‚Äì curious if this could be a possibility weather wise!  
‚Ä¢ Hot springs (during one of the Tuscany days)  
‚Ä¢ Lake Garda and Scaliger Castle (during one of the Bologna days, though might be a bit of a hike..)  
‚Ä¢ My sister loved Bologna and said to consider skipping Venice, but curious what others think.

We're leaning towards staying at a farmhouse/air b in Tuscany close to Montepulciano or Siena for 3 nights and using it as a home base for 3 days, as opposed to staying in Spello one night, Siena 2 nights, etc.   
We've also heard fun things about L'oro di Spello (the olive oil festival) but we're not totally set on that!

Any insight is appreciated and thank you so much in advance!",7,2024-11-01 14:11:55,Downtown_Bandicoot20,1.0

As of now I have roughly the first 15 days of my trip to Peru planned out (all in the south), and then after that I plan on just taking a bus north, may or may not stop at a few cities along the way in Peru, may or may not stop in Ecuador, and plan on also staying in Colombia for roughly 20 days.

1gpyaot,Cross country road trip in an RV with the family,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gpyaot/cross_country_road_trip_in_an_rv_with_the_family/,5,"Originally, I was planning on taking the summer off in between jobs with my family to take them on a cross country trip and visit states and parts of the country we haven't been before.  Because it would be a lot of time in a vehicle for kids, I was thinking about using a big RV so they wouldn't have to be strapped in the whole time.  

I guess I didn't understand the laws (or my parents) because growing up we would be moving around the RV while driving, although just to read books or go to the bathroom.  It's still kind of fuzzy to me because you can do that on buses.

Anyways, if we're going to be spending weeks in a vehicle with kids, is this still the best way to go? Maybe buying an old school bus? Is this like a speed limit says 70, but cops only pull you over for going 90 thing?

And yes, it is something we would all like to do.  We've done days long trips, just in the SUV, but I was trying to avoid that if possible.",5,2024-11-12 17:06:21,essendoubleop,0.99
1gpnaie,Possible bed bugs while traveling‚Äîwhat to do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gpnaie/possible_bed_bugs_while_travelingwhat_to_do/,5,"I‚Äôm on day four of a three-week international vacation. I stayed two nights in a hotel, and then yesterday, just before boarding a plane to my second destination, I noticed marks on my skin that look like bed bug bites. There are five on my left arm‚Äîone pair and one line of three‚Äîand then a cluster of three on my left hand. Maybe one more on my right thumb but it‚Äôs very faint and hard to be sure. I didn‚Äôt see any actual bed bugs, but it hadn‚Äôt occurred to me look until it was too late (lesson learned for future hotel stays).

We can debate whether I should‚Äôve boarded the plane at all but we‚Äôre past that point and I could really use your advice now. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done:

When I landed in my second destination yesterday, I immediately went to a laundromat and washed everything I had that seemed washable, including my backpack itself, and dried it on high heat for 30 minutes. (I have just that one bag, no other luggage.) I threw away the clothes I wore on the flight, and I wiped down and inspected my non-washable stuff like laptop and toiletries as well as I could. Then I went to the apartment of the friend I‚Äôm staying with (I explained everything before entering and offered to go to a hotel, but she was okay with me crashing) and put my stuff in trash bags. 

This morning I went to another laundromat  and washed and dried everything again. I also called the hotel, sent them pictures of my bites, and asked them to inspect the room. And that brings me to this moment, sitting in a kebab restaurant, trying to figure out my next move.

1. If these are indeed bed bug bites, how likely do you think it is that I picked up bed bugs from the hotel room? I mostly kept my belongings off the bed, though the room was small and I did put my shoes and dirty clothes on the floor.

2. How long will it take to for me to know if I‚Äôm in the clear? I‚Äôm planning to fly to my next destination in three days. If I see/feel no more signs of bed bugs in that time, am I likely okay?

3. Knowing all the above, should I cancel the rest of my trip? It would be awful, but less awful than spreading bed bugs to the friends I‚Äôm planning to see in the coming weeks. And probably still less awful than having to explain everything and thrust them into the same stress and uncertainty I‚Äôm feeling now.",17,2024-11-12 09:29:04,idadunnit,0.59

My itinerary roughly takes me Cancun - Playa Del Carmen - TBD - Merida - Izamal - Valladolid - Holbox - Cancun. So timing has me in Valladolid for Christmas. So where / what do I eat? I'm vegetarian and even if I can book hotel that serves food over Christmas, assuming that's an option, it's very unlikely to be something I can eat. So to apartments and Airbnb, but none that I have seen have an actual kitchen. Those showing as having one, in reality only have a microwave.

Spent last Christmas in CDMX and had an apartment so I could cook, glad I did cause there'd have been nowhere to eat. 

So I guess my question is are there any places open for food between evening of 24 - 26th. Or does anyone know of hotels here that do vegetarian food? Valladolid is already not the greatest for veg options, according to happycow. 

Or should I switch my focus back to Thailand?

1goyua6,What's your favorite destination for inexpensive tours/activities,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1goyua6/whats_your_favorite_destination_for_inexpensive/,5,"I've been thinking about where I want to go to next in my travels and I have been doing a lot of research but when I search for inexpensive places to travel I generally get a lot of results that heavily weight how expensive airfare and lodging is when talking about the travel cost. That makes sense for most people, but I typically have points to cover flights and hotels so what I would consider an inexpensive trip might not be the same as someone who has to pay for airfare and lodging. So I'm really looking for travel destinations where the cost for airfare and lodging doesn't matter, I am only really concerned about the cost of the fun activities and tours while I'm there. As far as activities go, I like to go do stuff with my time, not sit around in an all-inclusive resort or hang out at a beach all day. I'm also not particularly active so backpacking/camping/hiking/kayaking/etc are not things that appeal to me. I like things like museums, ruins, snorkeling, various tours, etc. Basically I want to get out and explore and see and do what there is to see and do in a place but I like to be comfortable while doing it. On a budget. 

The best example I can think of that I've been to has been Washington, D.C. because there are so many free museums and tours that you can do. There is also plenty of stuff you can pay for if you want, but you could go there and do nothing but free museums and tour government buildings/monuments for a week and be perfectly happy.

With that in mind, what is your favorite travel destination that has fun low-cost activities/tours where the price of airfare and lodging aren't considered. Why do you like that place, what are your favorite activities?",11,2024-11-11 12:11:41,ravenito,0.69

I live in Athens for two years and one question bothers me during my regular hiking around the city: why those natural hidden gems are so underrated?

Just one case! This stunning stone arch you may see on the above pics is located in just 5 km from the metro station. The entire route is about 10 km. However, it's not that popular as you could suppose, it's almost unknown even to locals, let alone tourists.

So I'm curious to know some things.

Do you plan any hiking activities when traveling abroad?

If you stay for a few days in capital cities (layover, etc.), would you be interested in visiting some not that well known, but not less amazing locations?

To be honest, people visiting only 'classic' touristic points and neglecting some unpopular beautiful spots make me upset a little bit. There's plenty of less known places which worth to see.

We are pretty active people but also enjoy a fun night out, however I would say we would prefer a more relaxing environment over party centric environment and ideally more secluded, couples getaway (not a lot of families/kids)

Ideally would love a place that doesn‚Äôt have too much of a mosquito problem because I get eaten alive (been to Costa Rica and was pretty miserable the entire trip despite using bug lotion but didn‚Äôt have the same problem in Playa Mujeres)

Food and good wine/cocktails are super important. Would be great to have nice dining options at the hotel property but open to going off site. We would not prefer an all inclusive because of this, I have never been to one with good food.

Would love oceanfront mid size to large resort, nothing too remote. Beach access is ideal!

As for overall vibe, we would prefer something a bit more low key (eg reggae music and more cultural influence of the island). We love our five star dining and luxe nights out but would also love opportunity to hit local beach bars and beachfront dining options with great food options and laid back atmosphere.

Snorkeling would be fun but this is not a major criteria, prefer better dining options and the tropical vibes over good snorkeling.

We‚Äôve been looking at St Lucia and Anguilla among many others but getting overwhelmed so would love recommendations from those who have traveled to Caribbean! And would love to hear recommendations for accommodations as well.

1geo8ho,Recommendations/advice for a long weekend solo in Bologna in December?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1geo8ho/recommendationsadvice_for_a_long_weekend_solo_in/,5,"With a few vacation days I need to use or lose by the end of the year, I'm thinking of doing Bologna. I love food, walking around places that are charming, and carbo-loading for long runs, so it seemed like a no-brainer. But I have done very little solo travel, and none of my friends have been to Bologna, so I'm hoping for some recommendations/advice for beefing up my itinerary:

1. Silly question, but how widely accepted is contactless? I wouldn't ask if I hadn't just been in Germany, which was basically cash-only, but now I'm extra paranoid.

2. Is a day trip to Ravenna enough time there? 

3. On the flip-side, are 3 days in Bologna a good amount of time? I'm more worried about it being too much time than not enough time.

4. Food/restaurant recommendations? I'm thinking of signing up for at least one walking food tour, so I'm not eating alone for every meal, but I generally try to eat local foods like locals as much as possible wherever I go. I mostly ask because I'm just not sure if places in Bologna are weird about seating solo diners like they can be in other places...

Any other recs or advice are much appreciated!",7,2024-10-29 01:32:09,helpapproaching,0.86
1gdlunu,Santiago to Mendoza bus with Andesmar. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gdlunu/santiago_to_mendoza_bus_with_andesmar/,5,"This is a report post. 

Posting this as I frequently use reddit for travel advice and wish to contribute for people who do the same. 

I booked ticket from Santiago to Mendoza with Andesmar for the beginning of the month of October. There were a few problems so I'm writing about it here. A brief outline below but in short:

1. The bus did not run.

2. The company did absolutely nothing to help/inform us despite having advance knowledge of the situation.

3. They ignored follow up contact for a refund.

4. I had to initiate a charge back to get my money back. 

The pass between Santiago and Mendoza was frozen over and the bus did not run. 

I hadn't seen or read about this before so just letting people know that it can happen. When I got to bus station they told me it had been closed for a couple of days and would likely remain closed for a few more days. 

This was not ideal as I had booked a non-refundable accomodation so was in line to lose a fair bit of money if I didn't get to Mendoza. 

My real issue is with the company though. They did not contact me to let me know the buses wouldn't run and instead I found out when I got to the station. They also essentially refused to respond to me at all after the fact. 

Over the course of the last few weeks I have used 3 points of contact (2 emails and 1 WhatsApp) to contact the company for a refund on 9 seperate occasions. I recieved one response, from the whatsapp, which provided an email that no one  responded to.

I ended up initiating a charge back on my card to get the refund. 

There were a couple of lessons in this for me, mainly to be careful over committing in terms of the non-refundable stuff. 

I ended up flying. The significant issue for me is that if the company actually told me on time I would have gotten much cheaper flights and not wasted a day hanging around in the airport. ",0,2024-10-27 16:32:15,CrushableStetson,1.0

The idea is to travel via train/bus and spend about 2-3 days in most of the places we go.  
  
As of right now, the routing I've come up with looks like this:

Ghent, Belgium (3 days)

 We are in our late 40s and have no kids, so it'll just be the two of us on this trip. We have travelled together more times than I can remember at this point, and some of our absolute favorite cities we've been to are Lisboa and Istanbul. We aren't looking to party or do any shopping‚Äîother than picking up small souvenirs for friends and family back home in the US. We don't want to be spending a fortune eating at Michelin starred restaurants, but very much enjoy tasting the traditional flavors of a place by eating in restaurants, cafes, and markets that the locals frequent. I am a photographer, so places with cool looking architecture and street photography opportunities are a huge plus. We also enjoy cities where its possible to see a lot just by walking around.

With all that in mind, any suggestions for whether Brussels or Antwerp would be a better fit for us would be greatly appreciated.",4,2024-10-27 10:31:10,ratsmasher77,1.0

We are spending 40 days in India this Jan-Feb, with focus on the north (Kolkata - Varanasi - Lucknow - Rishikesh - Shimla and spiti valley - Dharamshala - Amritsar - Jaipur - Delhi - Agra).

We have a spare 2 weeks after this period, which we can add to India, or fly to Nepal for a wee bit.

We are not planning on doing any serious treks there, just sink in the vibe and eventually go see Chitwan national park. 

The alternative to this is extending our India trip into Rajastan and Gujarat.  
My concern with Nepal is that, having visited the Himalayas from the indian site, we will not get that different experience in Nepal, compared to the hassle of getting there and back (we have a booked flight from Delhi that we need to get back to in any case).

Gujarat and Rajastan on the other hand offer a change in scenery and culture, which will contrast more with the far North we've been to on so far.

Quick advice for anyone wondering how to get a physical sim card if you're visiting and how easy it is.

**It's very easy!**

* Avoid official carrier stores/branches if you're staying less than a month as their pre-paid plans start at \~40GB \~30 days.  They \**might*\* also be more expensive and they might try to sell you a plan that you don't need.

* Shorter and smaller plans can be easily purchased at re-sellers (smaller kiosks and various stores) all over the city.

* They can be tricky to spot and the official stores likely won't help you find one as they want to sell you bigger plans.

* If you're not sure and want to ask them if they sell pre-paid cards, you can ask them: *¬øVenden tarjetas SIM prepago, por favor?*

* There are 3 popular carriers that can be found: WOM, Claro, Movistar and Entel.

* The best value we found was through WOM. We just bought the card, didn't need to share any information with the re-seller. Inserted the SIM card, called \*103 on the phone and it activated automatically.

* Keep in mind that I believe Chile requires you to register the phone if you are using it in the country for more than 30 days and there are likely fees involved.

**Idea of Prices (*****including SIM card*****):**

* **WOM Store \[30 days\]**:
   * 6,000 CLP
   * 30 Days
   * 50GB
* **Movistar Store \[30 days\]**:
   * 5,000 CLP
   * 40GB
   * 500 Minutes
* **WOM Re-Seller \[15 days\]**:
   * 2,000 CLP
   * 1GB
   * 50 Minutes
   * Unlimited Whatsapp

Hope this helps and please share any corrections or additional information that might need updating.

Happy travels!

1gp6i2h,South Korea + Tokyo trip?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gp6i2h/south_korea_tokyo_trip/,4,"Hi all,

I am trying to plan a trip to Asia with some friends in May 2025. For background, we went to Japan for two weeks a few years ago, going to Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, and Osaka. It was our all-time favorite country to visit, and we were able to explore everything we wanted to do. Now, we are debating which country we should go to this upcoming year: return to Japan or experience South Korea.

I looked at roundtrip plane tickets to both Seoul and Tokyo from the midwest USA, and the Japan tickets are half the price ($700 vs $1400). I figured why don't we go to Tokyo for 5 nights and purchase a Tokyo to Seoul and a Busan to Tokyo ticket for $300 to spend 9 nights around South Korea? This way, we fill our urge to return to Japan while getting to experience a whole new country close by.

My main questions include:

1. Does this itinerary even make sense? We would go to Tokyo (5 nights), then go from Tokyo to Seoul, then travel around Seoul (5 nights), then Gyeongju (2 nights) and Busan (2 nights), fly from Busan to Tokyo (stay in Tokyo 1 night), then return to America. I looked at the logistics and the timings make sense in theory.
2. If it does make sense, is 9 nights enough in South Korea? I am thinking about 5 nights in Seoul and 4 nights in Gyeongju and Busan. I think that 5 nights in Seoul is plenty long for us, as 5 nights in Tokyo was great. Any city recommendations in South Korea would be great, or if I should stick with the South Korea plan I have right now.

I feel like this would work in our situation as we have already previously been to Japan, so only going to Tokyo is fine for us as it was our favorite city. Anything I am missing or thoughts on this situation would help greatly.",19,2024-11-11 17:24:44,TheCheesyTaco,0.83

I'm picking up a car and the plan was originally to drive up CA-1 to San Francisco and then up the Oregon coast all the way to Portland. However, as a large portion of CA-1 is closed, now thinking if I should just take I-5 instead. If I do take I-5, how safe would it be to sleep in my car in a rest area. Also, it seems unless I get lucky with the weather, then the drive up the Oregon coast could be raining a lot, so seems pointless driving up the coast if not going to be able to see anything. So, now thinking about driving to South Lake Tahoe after San Francisco for a night. Then onto Zion, Grand Canyon, Las Vegas and then back to Los Angeles. I was researching the route from South Lake Tahoe and some people were suggesting to go via Death Valley. Is this better than the basin route. Is the Joshua Tree also worth visiting.

1gf6kjx,6 nights in Istanbul / 4 nights in Athens solo (long post ahead),https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gf6kjx/6_nights_in_istanbul_4_nights_in_athens_solo_long/,4,"I recently wrapped up a trip to Turkey and Greece, a pretty good one overall, and I'd like to share it, along with some impressions about the places themselves from an unabashedly touristic perspective (I am a tourist, after all; I make no other pretenses). Day to day first, but I'll try to keep it succinct and non-exhaustive to flesh out my takeaways.

**Day 0** - Arrived in Istanbul in the afternoon. My hotel was right in the thick of things in Sultanahmet, which was both a blessing and a curse. It did allow me to easily see Sultanahmet Square's sights right after arrival. Hagia Sophia lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest architectural works in history, but the experience is compromised by a lack of visitor access to most of the building since the mosque conversion.

**Day 1** - Topkapƒ± Palace and Hagia Irene to start. Love the setting, and the Ottomans were definitely not beating the ""oriental despotism"" allegations. Hagia Irene is undergoing some restoration and the nave was off-limits (this pattern repeats all over the city), but it's a somber place nonetheless. Bosphorus sunset cruise later, a definite trip highlight. The views were outstanding, and I met some cool people to hang out with along the way.

**Day 2** - Yedikule Fortress, a cool place, but a barebones experience. Got myself turned around and on the wrong side of Fatih when I got on the wrong bus, which took some time to right. Side note: they farm in the moat of the Theodosian walls. How strange. I then visited some of the great Ottoman mosques in Fatih and started on the museum circuit.

**Day 3** - Dolmabah√ße Palace, which was pretty cool, and then Rumeli Fortress, the biggest disappointment on the whole trip. The place is open and charges for entry, but the ongoing renovation means that you don't actually have access to anything of note. If you pay to enter, you pretty much just walk the footpath in and then back. Thankfully I found this out early and didn't pay. Mosque and lunch in Ortak√∂y and then Galata Tower.

**Day 4** - The Basilica Cistern, with a very cool atmosphere inside, and then continuing on with the museums in Sultanahmet.

**Day 5** - Nuruosmaniye Mosque in the morning. In this chaotic city, one of my favorite little moments was having this place to myself and enjoying the morning sun beaming in through the stained glass. Grand Bazaar and more museums after.

**Day 6** - To Athens. My flight started a bit late, so I retread some old ground in Istanbul before heading to the airport. Got to Athens pretty late.

**Day 7** - The Acropolis and most of what's around it. The meat and potatoes of Athens pretty much came on this day. The Acropolis was pretty amazing, if extremely crowded.

**Day 8** - The agorae in the morning and a sunset trip to the Temple of Poseideon at Cape Sounion later on. It's a long ride to the cape, but the views are spectacular. The crowds converge on the cliffs for sunset, allowing you to enjoy the ruins in relative peace as the sun disappears behind them and bathes the Aegean in orange.

**Day 9** - Lycabettus Hill and some of the museums in the area.

**Day 10** - Homeward bound. Brutal travel day, connecting back through Istanbul.

-----

Thoughts on Istanbul:

* The history of the place is second to none, and it permeates everything when walking around. My hotel clung to a Roman wall, and the past pokes out everywhere. The old Ottoman buildings abound everywhere, though often in various states of disrepair. This is probably my favorite aspect of the city.

* It's a lot. The city is very crowded, both with locals and tourists, and there is a deep, contagious sense of impatience. It's loud and chaotic as well. The walls of my hotel were very thin, and I was kept up in the very early morning multiple times by drivers sitting opposed to each other and honking because nobody was willing to back up and move. I also found myself doing things I would ordinarily never do to get around, like jaywalking in front of moving trains. The sheer humanity, and the disorganization of it, required that.

* Istanbul is a true meeting of the worlds. The word ""diverse"" is one of the most abused in the English lexicon, but it applies in the truest sense here. All civilizations really do converge in the City of the World's Desire. I even saw an arriving flight from Ouagadougou, of all places.

* Every man, woman, and child in Istanbul seems to have a cousin in Cleveland and a rug shop around the corner. One time I couldn't avoid one of these guys, since I was going his direction as well, so I trolled him a bit, playing dumb until we got to his store and then refusing entry. Nevertheless, I have been spoiled in other places where I didn't have to anticipate what sales angle was behind any given interaction. It seemed to put other tourists on edge as well, with one being a total bitch to me when I tried to ask a question (I think she mistook me for a local).

* Speaking of sales, the touts were not as bad as in some other places, but they were enough to be a persistent annoyance. Good luck taking a quick peak at a restaurant menu without the most persistent man you've ever met offering you the world on a platter to sit and not taking even a tepid ""maybe later"" for an answer. I'm a disagreeable bastard, so this kind of thing doesn't work on me, but I could see some people getting eaten alive there. I was talking to some American black women in the airport, and one said that a tout called her ""Nutella."" They might want to work on their approach.

-----

Thoughts on Athens:

* Compared to Istanbul, it's a much more laid back and friendly place, which I greatly appreciated. Just about everybody I interacted with was very nice, and the sense of impatience I felt in Istanbul was nonexistent in Athens. Service was generally of a higher quality. I also had the coolest driver to/from the airport, and he took my WhatsApp and sent links to places to check out. Low sample size, but the Athenians are apparently proud of their city and want you to enjoy it.

* Athens' relationship with its past felt a bit more like an attraction to me. Istanbul is virtually built inside its own ruins, but Athens sections everything off and advertises the shit out of it. I suppose I can summarize the feeling I got as ""Istanbul is surrounded by its past out of circumstance, but Athens has its past sitting in convenient pockets to sell to foreign tourists.""

* Athens was also quite crowded, but this was more identifiably touristy. Istanbul was a definite mix of local and touristic chaos, tilting toward the latter with proximity to Sultanahmet Square, but Athens was throngs of people around the Acropolis and Plaka, with my most heard languages being English and Mandarin, with peace elsewhere. Plaka was borderline impassable during the mid-afternoon.

* Food-wise, simplicity seemed to be key. The $4 souvlaki I had in a random place might have been the best thing I ate on the whole trip. Also I have to find Mastika in the US. It's like crack in liquid form.

-----

On the whole trip:

* I made more of an effort to spread things out and slow the pace down, and that became totally necessary. Istanbul in particular is tiring to get around with how hilly it is.

* I've never been asked to speak so many languages in one relatively short trip. Even just on the street, people came up to me speaking Turkish, Greek, and German several times, and in the case of the first two, were surprised that I didn't understand them. I was at least able to talk to the German guy.

* Shout out to my American homies. You guys are cool everywhere in the world I run into you. I know it's easy to get tribal at home (I'm guilty of it as well), but we can still be friends.",7,2024-10-29 16:51:35,thisistheperfectname,1.0

1gegvfw,Moving Our Dogs From California to Germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gegvfw/moving_our_dogs_from_california_to_germany/,4,"\*\*First things first, I know that flying your dogs is a stressful thing to put them through but I refuse to leave them behind. I've had my huskies since they were puppies and the little chihuahua mix I picked up off the streets a year ago and so these dogs are my family so they have to come. It just is what it is. This part of the move is the most stressful out of everything we have to plan for so please no judgement on this and only helpful information please :)\*\*

So my husband just accepted a position through his current company that would move us from CA to Germany. We haven't gotten an exact location yet but think we'll be flying into Munich. I've been looking all over reddit and other articles about transporting your dogs through airlines. I've heard the best airline to do that through is Lufthansa. We have three dogs; 2 huskies, 55lb and 70lb and a 25lb chihuahua mix. On the Lufthansa website it gives a lot of great information but I was wondering if anyone has made similar moves through the Munich airport.

**\*On the Lufthansa website it notes:** no animals are accepted in the cargo hold on connecting flights via Munich. Through-checking of animals transported in the cargo hold is not possible at Munich Airport. The booking of transit and connecting flights with checked-in animals and their through-checking is still possible via Frankfurt.

\*Does this mean I can fly directly into Munich with no issues because it's not my layover location or would I need to fly into Frankfurt and make a longer drive (we plan on booking a direct flight from LAX to Munich to not have to worry about them needing to get on and off different planes). Also, I plan on calling the customer service center to get confirmation from them about this question but wanted to know if anyone has already done it and get their feedback on it.

Also, my next question is: what crates have people used when flying their dogs internationally? I keep looking for IATA regulated crates but some reviews have said that some of them aren't actually IATA compliant. So any extra info on this would be greatly appreciated! - also plan to buy airtags to attach to the kennels.

Do people put any blankets or anything in the crates for the pups to be comfortable or maybe a chew toy or something? My oldest dog is 10 years old so I'm most concerned about him. I plan on getting blood work and everything done on all my dogs to make sure they are in perfect health before we leave. But what does everyone do for that? I do know that I need to put in a puppy pad for them and then I have a water bottle I plan to add for it too.

Anyways that might have been a lot to read but if you have made it to the end what advice do you have to help with transporting your pets internationally?",83,2024-10-28 18:45:09,Narrow-Landscape5187,0.55

- Days 1-2: Tokyo - Flight arrives at 9pm. So this is really just a day to adjust.
- Days 3-7: Osaka - For day trips and nightlife  
- Days 8-14: Tokyo - This is where things get weird. I‚Äôll be meeting a group of friends for this leg of the trip which means adapting to their itinerary and making several duplicating stops

- Days: 22-26: Ho Chih Minh - Back to traveling solo, hoping to pick up a custom suit. Is that possible in 5 days? If not, I can stop over to pick it up on my way back to Japan
- Days 27-31: Hanoi - Solo

I'm looking for a map where I can put all the previous itineraries I've had in my life. 

So for example if I drove from Rome to Milan, I'd like to add that itinerary on the app and make it permanent like a route I've discovered on the globe. 

I don't want to add the whole state as the majority of the app does, I'm looking for this specific feature which I believe highlights more the places you've visited rather than colorizing a huge state even if you visited just one small cities of it...

I already have ""world uncovered"" however it doesn't allow me to add previous travels and since I've installed it recently there's just a few travels there.

Do anyone know for an app like the one I'm looking for?

1gb4lgy,3 Week New Zealand South Island Itinerary Advice ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gb4lgy/3_week_new_zealand_south_island_itinerary_advice/,4,"Hi Everyone! 

My husband and I are travelling to New Zealand from Colorado, USA for our honeymoon and will be there from November 30 to December 20. I would love any advice on my current itinerary. We are flying into and out of Queenstown and are renting a campervan for the whole time. We do still want to stay in some nice hotels for a few nights, and I am hoping to have a good balance of seeing as much of the South Island as possible but getting to spend enough time in certain locations to really be able to experience it. We are also both avid hikers and love all outdoors activities. We are hoping to get as much hiking in as we can and do some surfing and kayaking. I know the weather will likely still be pretty cold, but we are bringing our wetsuits along so we can still spend some time on the water. 



\-Nov 30: Fly into Queenstown, get rental van, groceries etc and head right to Manapouri.

\-Nov 30 - Dec 3: Overnight boat cruise in Doubtful Sound 

\-Dec 3 - Dec 6: Head to Mount Cook and stay in campsites. Do as many day hikes as we can. 

\-Dec 6 - 7: Head to Christchurch. Replenish groceries and rest. I am not sure that I need to stay too long here. 

\-Dec 7 - 9: Get to Kaikoura. Do water sports, find somewhere fun to stay. Relax and spend time on the beach. 

\-Dec 9 - 11: Pepin Island: Stay at Rocky Point Hut and explore/kayak 

\-Dec 11 - 14: As many hikes in Abel Tasman as we can. 

\-Dec 14 - 15: Spend overnight in a hotel in Punakakai 

\-Dec 15 - 17: Head to Franz or Fox Glacier. Do a heli-hike tour. 

\-Dec 17 - 20: Back to Queenstown. Do the bungee jumping/rafting. Return camper van. Depart very early morning on the 20th. 



Questions or advice: 

\-Am I spending too little or too much time in one place? 

\-Is there anything that is an absolute must- see that I am missing? 

\-I have been back and forth on the glaciers. We very much like to avoid large crowds and I know that this place is very touristy. But I also know that it is very unique. Is it worth the crowds of people to do the heli hike? \*\*NOTE\*\* I know a majority of the places I have on my list are very tourisity. But I am also using the NZ Frenzy Guidebook to help me identify some additional beautiful places that are a bit more secluded and are still on my route. 

We are so incredibly excited! No matter how things go, we will have an amazing time, but any help or advice will be so appreciated. 

Thank you!!!!

We mostly dined at local mom-and-pop restaurants, enjoying authentic, mid-range meals. Our accommodations were mostly Airbnbs, and we avoided anything too high-end. Overall, the trip felt as affordable as many places in Mexico, and even comparable to Thailand in terms of costs.

At that time, the Lira was rapidly losing value, but lately, I've seen more chatter about Turkey being ‚Äòshockingly expensive,‚Äô even pricier than Greece and other EU destinations, as a result of skyrocketing inflation.

* **Issue**: The first flight (MS255) was canceled due to technical problems. I was rebooked on a later flight (MS257), but it was also severely delayed (over 6 hours), causing me to miss the connection in Cairo.
* **New Flights**: EgyptAir rebooked me for the next day on flights Cairo to Paris (MS799) and Paris to Lisbon (AF1124). While the Cairo-Paris flight went smoothly, the Paris-Lisbon flight was canceled due to a technical issue with Air France. I finally flew back on August 31, arriving in Lisbon more than 40 hours late.

Has anyone successfully gotten compensation from EgyptAir in a similar situation? What steps should I take next?

I know it‚Äôs going to miserably cold but I think he‚Äôll enjoy the novelty of it all. 

We plan to fly in and out of Copenhagen from India as those are the least expensive tickets we can find. We plan to do 4 days in Copenhagen, 3/4 days in Kiruna, 4 days in Stockholm, maybe 1 more day in copenhagen before departure.

-lego store 
-copenhagen zoo
-rosenborg palace 
-Tivoli christmas market 
-nyhvan 
-orsted park/torvehallerne
-a public children's library

Kiruna 
-Husky dog sledding (hopefully on his birthday!)
-northern lights 

Stockholm
-Skansen
-Vasa musuem 
-a good children's public library 
-ikea (my husband and I just really like IKEA lol)
-juinbacken
-Gamla stan christmas market 
-tyresta national park (would weather permit?)

We enjoy cozy cafes, good food and art. Or chill places to grab a drink where kids would be welcome too. Would welcome any suggestions around these as well! 

We plan to stay in airbnbs for most of our trip. If there are any tried &amp; tested hotels/boutique hotels, we'd love to experience those too. 

We want the trip to be relaxed and fun with lots of art, food and coffee + experiences for my son that he wouldn't have back home.

My partner (26F) and I (34M) from Canada have 9 nights at the end of our London trip to spend in and around the Alps from Dec 30 to Jan 8 and need some advice!

The main part of the trip will be 5 nights deep in the Alps. Thinking to split it between two towns, snowboarding  (intermediate to advanced) a day in each. A few of the towns/areas on our minds are Chamonix, Cervinia, Verbier/4 Vallees, Portes du Soleil, Zermatt...etc. We are OK to spend some money for these days as this would most likely be the only time we will ever spend in the Alps during the winter. Food, culture, town vibe, and scenery are most important. Don't want huge crowds or huge costs though, just a great Alps experience! Will most likely spend our last night in Geneva and fly home via London from there. 

The second part is the less important part: 4 nights over New Years. We want to chill out as we will have just had a wild and expensive Christmas week in London with the holidays and a wedding. Ideally either a city, like Torino, or a cozy countryside/mountainside town near the Alps since we will need to get to the Alps immediately afterwards. We don't want to spend much money or do anything for New Years, just hangout and eat and explore a bit. 

It had been pretty daunting figuring out where to go due to the many options. The western Alps seem to make the most sense due to accessibility, but really open to anything in the Alps, or even Dolomites. 

Thanks!

I'm happy to take flights between countries if it makes sense too. I'd love to experience nature, meet people, sample some city life and maybe do a surf camp and a few weeks at a language school - oh also some volunteering if I can!

The only definite thing I have booked is my flight out to Cancun. After that I only have the most vague idea of countries/route... My must sees are Salt Flats, Iguazu falls, Lake Titicaca, Machu Picchu, CDMX and I haven't looked into beaches yet.

So far I'm thinking¬†**Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil**¬†and maybe¬†**Chile/Argentina**.

I enjoy a bit of nightlife, hiking, general mooching about and taking in the sights and I'm very flexible in terms of if I meet good people then I'm happy to adapt to go with the flow. But yeah so far I have no idea how to go about planning this and would love any help!

Heading to Japan in winter (february). It's my third trip to Japan, so done the more touristy things already. First part of this upcoming trip will be skiing in Niseko, with some time in Nagano region and finally some days in Tokyo. Itinerary is as follows but got a few questions about these specific things:

\- 5 nights in Niseko

\- 1 night Lake Toya

\- 2 nights Sapporo

\- 1 night Nigata (spending a night there cause we arrive from Sapporo to Nigata airport)

\- 3 nights Matsumoto (day trip to Nagano and maybe day trip to Narai)

\- 4 nights in Tokyo (with posible day trip to Nikko).

Wanted to ask if the time in Sapporo is an ok amount. We won't be doing snow activities (sledding, etc) because we already spent several days skiing by that point, so it would be mostly sightseeing.

The night in Nigata I'm a bit torn about. Not sure if it's worth it to do a stop there or go directly to Matsumoto.

Finally, using Matsumoto as base for exploring Nagano region makes sense? Is it better to stay in Matsumoto vs Nagano?

Something I'd love to do instead is find a trip where I don't really have to plan much: to go somewhere and have a lot of options to just observe / participate in things without much advance notice.

I'm NOT against going to CT as I love going to new places I just have zero experience there so it makes it a bit more complex. So here I am to the wise people of Reddit. I personally am in NJ and I don't mind a drive but definitely not trying to go anywhere farther than 3-5 hr drive away (5 is really pushing it) 

The main want I have is to get a great massage! Everything else is kind of a side note but a massage and a relaxing environment is the goal for my birthday as I've been spending the last year leaving a bad relationship, working full time, and going to school at nights/online to get my LPN so I've been just a huge ball of stress. 

I really want to just find a nice spa to go  to as every Spa Stay I've been looking into is just not a comfortable price point for me, and if I'm not comfortable spending my part I refuse to put that type of financial burden on my friends just for the spa stay not including food and anything else. So I'd rather fine an amazing spa to visit for a day and then we can leave and go back the local hotel/airbnb and still be able to have a good budget to eat at nice restaurants and so on 

If anyone knows anywhere that's really nice and gives you a luxe feel but not a stay mandatory place and it's a total budget blower!

I live in Chicago, and am flying United (I have flight benefits). I would leave tomorrow, (Saturday 9 November) and can come back as late as the following Sunday, though a day later would work if needed for flight purpposes. So roughly 6-7 days So my destination considerations are all UAL destination cities. I want to go somewhere I haven't been before, and most of these destinations are either all new to me or substantially new. I have done some research (I almost traveled in October) but some beta from others who know the places would be nice. This seemed like a good place to ask. Options below:

1)Fly to Paris. Would spend a day or two visiting friends outside the city. Beyond that I thought I'd take a train and visit Nimes. With a whole week maybe go back to Paris and then to Strasbourg, from where I could visit the National Automobile Museum in Mulhouse.  Is Basel worth considering? What other places are worth considering? What about, say, Rouen? I have been to Paris and the Dordogne and that is it for France for me. Flights are direct from ORD.

2)Fly to Lisbon. I was going to go to Lisbon and Porto in July with friends and then Crowdstrike happened. Never been to Portugal but have beta from the friends so a relatively known option. Bonus is that it's warm and sunny. I have to connect through EWR or IAD, so a bit more flying risk.

3)Fly to Berlin. I've never been to Germany. Berlin and Munich are the cities that interest me most, probably in that order. No idea what I'd want to see there since I hadn't thought about it much. Have to connect to get there.

4)Fly to Munich - see above. Direct from ORD.

5)Fly to Milan. I've never been to Italy either. I could go to Rome but for some reason the north interests me more and it's a safer flying option. Bonus us there's a big classic car show in Milan at the end of the week. From here I could take trains to Turin, also to Modena (Ferrari - I'm very much a car person) or Bologna. Lago di Garda? I like trains but perfectly happy to drive somewhere in a rental if it makes sense (I find Europe a pleasure to drive in) Direct from ORD.

6)Fly to Frankfurt. Frankfurt itself doesn't interest me, but I could get a rental and visit the Nurburgring from there (bucket list item), also Strasbourg (see above) seems doable. What is worth seeing in that part of Germany?

Edit: 7)Fly to Barcelona. I have been to Barcelona before and the idea here would be go to to the Pyrenees and go hiking and stay in one or two places that are smaller, interesting, not expensive and quiet. I assume I would rent a car for this. I suppose I could go to France, too. I have to connect through EWR or IAD, so a bit more flying risk.

Buenos Aires is also an option and I have good beta on that, but I'd probably rather wait until I can spend two weeks in Argentina. Cape Town is also a stretch option.

Ideas welcome! I'd like to keep total cost excluding flights to under $1000USD. The more under the better but I'll pay for experiences if it's worth it.",23,2024-11-08 10:06:07,Barutano74,0.71

Looking for some feedback for how to structure my time in cusco.

My interests: I would really like to see 
1. cusco city (self guided) 
2. cusco ruins (saqsayhuaman, temples etc) ideally with a tour 
3. bit of the sacred valley.  My interests are mostly active culture, citys, and landscapes. I appreciate ruins but am not too thrilled at the thought of touring them for a full day.

Itinerary is:
DAY 1
- land in cusco at 12pm. 
- Plan- stroll around, get currency, sim card
- city tour???

DAY 2
- undecided plans. Debating between 1- Sacred valley full day bus tour. 2- Cusco city tours with ruins 3- ATV tour of maras moray.
Open to suggestions here??
- I want to account for acclimatization time. I want to have a good time and not be miserable and sick. 
-The ATV tour sounds the most exciting but i don‚Äôt know if i will be acclimated enough to do it right on day 2? 

DAY 3- full day machu picchu tour
DAY 4-6- Amazon tour, return to cusco
DAY 7- 
- flight to cusco at ~6pm
- would ideally like to take it easy &amp; just stroll around. But im open to any activity tour ideas? 


Questions-
- looking for suggestions for how to structure my time to see cusco city, cusco ruins and sacred valley between day 1, 2 and 7. 
1. Should i do a city tour on Day 1 after landing? Most city tours run 1-2pm onwards. Which i don‚Äôt think would be realistic given the time I land in cusco, check in, i need to get currency, sim card etc?
2. What would you suggest for Day 2? Your experience with doing an ATV tour on day 2 in cusco? Will it be ok with acclimatization time? 
3. Anything I can do in the morning of day 7? 
4. Where could i fit in a tour of the ruins in cusco? I would ideally like a guide?

Alternatively, I'm considering doing half in Cusco and half in the Amazon. My budget overall is about 3k USD not including international airfare.

also i just saw today that my I-94 travel history disappeared today even though it worked like yesterday or the day before? is that connected to the correction I asked for?

Days 1-3 Antigua: Adjust to altitude, explore the city. Potentially a day trip to Chichicastenango (we've considered doing this from Atitlan as well)

4-5: Acatenango volcano hike

6-9: Shuttle to and stay around Atitlan. Thinking about splitting 2 nights each in San Pedro and Santa Cruz. Want to hit some of the trails (Indian Nose, Lower Mayan, maybe San Pedro), might take a weaving workshop. Otherwise relax and explore the towns around the lake.

10: Travel all day travel to Lanquin

11-12 Semuc Champey: Probably going to do a tour the first day and self-guided the second.

13: Most of the day will be shuttling to Flores. Still haven't decided if we want to stay in Flores or Tikal.

14 Flores: Spend sunrise at Tikal, explore the ruins

15 Flores/Travel Home: Have half a day or so to spend in Flores/Tikal before we have to fly back to Guatemala City and then home from there.

We're a bit sketchy on the journey to Semuc Champey being worth it, buuuuuuut after trawling dozens of threads of people complaining about the journey being awful and somehow still being worth it, we're getting too much FOMO to not try it. Any opinions on that or too much/too little time in other places would be great!

Currently we have these options:

&amp;Beyond

* 3 night &amp;Beyond Grumeti Serengeti River Lodge

* 2 nights &amp;Beyond Bateleur Camp

Asilia

* 2 nights Neptune Ngorongoro Luxury Lodge
* 3 nights Asilia Sayari Camp
* 2 nights Asilia Naboisho Camp

I saw rave reviews for Asilia Namiri Plains Camp, should we go there instead one of the other locations? There's supposed to be a lot of big cats at Namiri, which are my favorites. Moreover, we've seen the big 5 in South Africa but we haven't seen cheetahs on a safari. We're also planning a hot air balloon ride, looks like both providers booked it in Masai Mara.

Should I:
a) Book the latest flight out of Siem Reap (around 8:35 PM) so we can maximise our time in HCM, or

1gi3ip9,My Time at Egypt during September,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gi3ip9/my_time_at_egypt_during_september/,2,"I, 28M from India, visited the country of Egypt last September and turned out to be one of the best trips I ever had. It was like dream come true moments where you got to see ancient structures not in documentaries/videos but with my own eyes and feeling the history right before me.

I have seen many videos and documentaries on Egypt and was on my travel radar for more than a decade and since there were many sites to visit, I opted to visit three main cities which were of significant importance in Egypt before the Third Intermediate Period. So did some research on it and found out the places that might suit me and also will be able to cover sights of significant importance.

Following was my Itinerary :

Day 1 : Land at Cairo and rest of the day was free and went on night street walks in Cairo

Day 2 : Visiting Pyramids of Giza, Egyptian Museum and NMEC and took flight to Luxor

Day 3 : Visiting Valley of Kings, Valley of Queens, Colossi of Memnon

Day 4 : Hot air balloon ride, Temple of Hatshepsut, Ramesseum and Medinat Habu

Day 5 : Luxor museum, mummification museum, Luxor temple and Karnak temple

Day 6 : Car drive to Aswan and on the way visited Edfu, Kom Ombo and Esna temples

Day 7 : Entire day for Abu Simbel and then Felucca ride on Nile

Day 8 : Aswan high Dam, Kalabsha Temple, Philae temple and unfinished obelisk. Then took a night flight to Cairo.

Day 9 : Visited pyramids in Dahshur(Bent and Red Pyramid) and Saqqara(Djoser Step pyramid and Pyramid of Teti) and finished the day in Memphis

Day 10 : Fayoum Oasis (Wadi al Rayan, Wadi el Hitan, Mudawara mountain, Magic lake and Sandboarding)

Day 11 : Back to home

We chose the off season to travel to avoid some crowds but it was the best decision we took as we had many sites just to ourselves. We mostly finished our trips before 3 pm to avoid the heat and exhaustion, and spent rest of our time talking with egyptian people and walking the streets at night to have a feel for country. The only sites that were crowded during our visit was Pyramids of Giza, Egyptian Museum, Karnak Temple and Abu Simbel. Rest were all either medium or no crowds. Especially Edfu, Kom Ombo, Valley of queen, Ramesseum, Hatshepsut temple, Pyramids in Dahshur had no people at all while we visited. Also I felt, Luxor and Aswan is much more peaceful and enjoyable than Cairo, so might suggest you to spend more time in those two cities. Lastly, the food - it was magnificent. I loved it to core and the platters of dishes that they presented were mind blowing.

And as for Egypt as country, I have seen videos about Egypt on how people scam you, unsafe for travelers and so on. Of course, there were some scams (which is not only exclusive for Egypt as every country has some sort of scam) but it was mostly concentrated only around tourist sites especially around Giza Plateau. But, once we went out of it, the people were amazing and caring. For example, I had an interstitial ligament tear on my left knee (permanent souvenir) during sandboarding and I thought of bearing the pain. But the guide took me to nearby village and the way people took care of me, I can't explain in words. They made me feel like I was special. So, for anyone traveling to Egypt after seeing some Youtube videos, be cautious but don't travel with prejudice.

As for my suggestions, visit to Bent and Red pyramid should be a must (unless you have some back or leg problem or claustrophobic). The Bent pyramid was more adventurous and fun than the other pyramids. So, if you are okay with navigating narrow causeways that go up and down, it's a must visit.

The only negative was the cat calling that we faced by local shops in certain areas based om our ethnicity but our guide resolved those and made sure our trip was pleasant. And some sellers try to follow and force you to buy products, but a simple No will stop them from doing that. So it won't be a big deal. Also, note that as foreigners, any items that you buy will be priced higher than the same item being sold to local. If your guide is friendly enough you can ask him to negotiate and buy it at much lower cost, saving you some bucks.

I want to share more details of all the good things that happened during this trip, but didn't want to make the post long. But, as my dream to visit Egypt, it turned out to be greater than what i dreamt off!!! Until Next Time Egypt!!",1,2024-11-02 13:53:25,No_Introduction_2856,0.63

The tours advertized online cost around $200-250 per person, which is more than we can comfortably spend, so I'm looking into organizing the trip independently if possible or with a local guide (french or english speaking would be ideal) I read that Joffreville is about a 45-minute drive from Antsiranana and close to the park entrance. Does anyone know if it‚Äôs possible to explore the park without a guide, or if there are guides available in Joffreville/Antsiranana that won't charge an arm and a leg?

I really appreciate any local insights or advice on making this experience happen within our budget. I really wish I had more time to explore your country. Do we have time for all this in under 11h?

My plan B would be Three Bays of Antsiranana: For scenic views and beach walks, this area is closer and accessible by taxi (according to the internet.) If we have to settle for it we will but I would really love to go to montagne d'ambre.

I've also looked into a car service, which is of course a lot more expensive but would mitigate those concerns. 
Is it acceptable to be that nuisance tourist couple on the tube, or should I take the car service? I'd be arriving hopefully at 10:15 am and I understand traffic is awful so  which would be quicker? My hotel is near the Tower of London.

1geq14g,Serbian Passport / travel inside europe,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1geq14g/serbian_passport_travel_inside_europe/,2,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôd appreciate some advice on traveling with my cat, who originally came from Serbia. Here‚Äôs the full story:

**Background**:

* My cat arrived from Serbia to France last year. At that time, everything was up to date: he had his Serbian pet passport, was microchipped, received his rabies vaccination, and passed a rabies titer test‚Äîall in line with EU requirements for non-EU animals.
* After moving to France, I didn‚Äôt get around to renewing his rabies booster on time. As a result, when I eventually went to the vet, I was told we‚Äôd have to start the rabies vaccination process from scratch (a new primary vaccine, rather than a simple booster).
* On **October 2nd**, he received this new primary rabies vaccine in France, and I plan to travel to Poland on **November 2nd**‚Äîexactly 30 days after this vaccination.
* I‚Äôm currently based in France, and the original Serbian passport still contains all his initial vaccinations and rabies titer test records, but now his updated rabies shot isn‚Äôt linked to any EU documentation.
* He's also registered to ICAD

Now, I‚Äôd like to travel to Poland with him, and I‚Äôm unsure about the following:

**Questions**:

1. **Is the Serbian pet passport enough for travel within the EU, or do I need an EU pet passport?**
2. **Can a French vet transfer his Serbian vaccination and titer test records to an EU pet passport, even if the rabies booster wasn‚Äôt done on time?**
3. **Should I carry both his Serbian and EU passports if I get him an EU one, or would just the EU passport be acceptable at the airport?**
4. **Was I supposed to redo the rabies titer test after the primary vaccine restart?** Since his initial titer test was done in Serbia, I‚Äôm not sure if the new vaccination would require another test for EU travel.

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much!",1,2024-10-29 03:53:50,BulkyDragonfruit6052,0.6
1gekyc1,[Bogota Report] - Vale la pena ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gekyc1/bogota_report_vale_la_pena/,2,"Hey, after I read thru scrolls n scrolls of reddit-bashing of Manila and Cairo and then went there and enjoyed the shit out of my time, I decided to do the same and travel to Bogota, now after being here for 1month + I want to review it so maybe a soul reads this and figures fuck this I'll give Bogota a chance

I want to first say I speak conversational spanish and this skews the review greatly. I recommend learning a bit before as getting conversational in spanish is not very hard and will unlock a full continent for you to explore in the native language.

**what you read negative online and it's true:**

* **the public transport is shit (there's no metro)**  I circumvent this by very cheap moto-ubers (1$-1.5$ each)  some may say they are dangerous, but you rarely ever go over 30-40km/h as there is traffic. They are all obligated to provide helmets as well. Much faster than regular ubers. all in all this doesn't affect me
* **it is more dangerous than other places** I circumvent this by not being a dumbfuck.  jokes aside, petty theft is rampant in Bogota and everyone local or tourist has a story to tell. in the end, its statistics, so it can always happen to you, if you just give them your shit you will leave unscathed in 99.99999% of encounters. nothing ever happened to me, but I am fully aware it is a possibility. Live in good neighborhoods and the odds drop s i g n i f i c a n t l y.
* **colombian cuisine** I don't want to riff on on how much I don't like the local cuisine but I don't like it. I like very spicy food with a lot of condiments and this is something that simply Colombians don't like/don't use.  However, Bogota is a prime spot for all sorts of cuisines, and the meats and vegetables/fruits are amazing - I am talking about specifically colombian cuisine - everyone has their own taste buds advice: some smart foreigners I met here brought their own condiments/sauces on the plane (no joke) they are expensive here and few and far in between (5$ for pepper??? )

**what you read negative online and it isn't true:**

* **everyone is out there to get you** oh my god are colombians fkin friendly especially if you speak spanish. everyone that I met here was extremely cool even if with some I didn't necessarily vibe it always felt very human and normal agreeing to disagree/parting. I went alone to parties, some dodgy places too, got batshit wasted, drank with bartenders in closed bars at 5AM, no one took advantage of me and most of the people actually advised me on what to try to do to avoid badstuff
* **girls will scopolamine -datedrug u at first opportunity** Yeah this is way way way more rare than the internet makes you think. A girl I've been with told me she has a friend who does this as a job in a strip club where she (my friend) also got scopolamined by a random dude there. but we're talking about a dodgy ass strip club. this was the closest reference to it in my month here. the ppl here are amazingly funny and just be a good judge of character and you will meet some amazing people. I met plenty of ppl from Bumble with 0 bad juju
* **bogota is grey, boring, the weather is bad, nothing to do here go to Medellin** Yeah this is probably the farthest one from the truth, there's so much to do here, art, galleries, workshops, schools - Bogota is the engine-hub of Colombia, Medellin is 90%+ tourism. If you're going on a short vacation, yea maybe, but more than that Bogota has plenty to offer, including a ton of nature hikes around the city. Bogotans actually enjoy the weather, it gets a lot of sun but is does rain or is cold from time to time, it is however never very cold or very hot, which comes in handy on a longer time horizon 







**tips:**   
\-go to language exchange events (gringo tuesdays, dame tu lengua)   
 you will learn some spanish and make some buddies, win win  
\-stay in the microbarrio of palermo or parkway in the barrio of teusaquillo   
everything you need in a 5 minute radius, close to Chapinero, feels more local than Chapi, alternative crowd, very tranquil and feels pretty safe  
\-Rappi is shit, expensive (compared to getting it delivered from the place in question) and just an overall very bad app - that being said it is still very useful  
\-speak spanish  
\-don't show off  
\-have fun

  
**disclaimers:**  
when I felt something is dodgy and my paranoia kicked in, I simply fucked off. I will never know if those guys meant bad, but I am very content not finding out either. cases in question:

\-arriving from Cali to Bogota I was very tired and didn't want to trek to the Uber pick up spot, so after a bit of negotiation I just went with a random cabdriver from there (don't do this some cabs here are notorious scammers/kidnappers. there's a guy in a suit exactly as you exit the gate, talk to him for a cab if you don't uber). So this random cab driver pointed another driver to come, and when I went with his driver to his car, I saw the first dude try to get in in front, so I asked him why, he said smth like is it ok with u for us to grab lunch on the way or something and I waas like fuck no I'm out so I simply bolted out while they kept yelling at me to come back

\-a moto driver I befriended proposed to me that he knows a girl if I want. blocked him 2mins after I got off his bike, just seemed very scopolamine-y to me

\-saw a bartender handle my not-empty drink when I was coming back from the bathroom. I just fucked off. In retrospect, I think this was innocent, bar was empty it was early and he probably thought I'm leaving, but it was my first days here so I was extra paranoid

\-if I know I go out at night in dodgy places, I only carry what I need and don't linger. if I need to take out money at night, card is in my sock. I also have a burner phone.

1gdwuv6,Struggling With One Month Philippines Itinerary ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gdwuv6/struggling_with_one_month_philippines_itinerary/,4,"Hello! I'm travelling to the Philippines next week and as the title says, I'm really struggling with putting together my one month itinerary. I'm flying into Cebu in the evening and flying out of Manila early morning so already lose 2 days there. 

I know the things I want to do but I don't know in what order to do them or even if I can fit it all in. Usually I would just go with the flow and whatever happens happens, but because of the cost of domestic flights, I really need to consider booking some things as soon as possible. I would love some help in deciding how long to stay in each place, or whether to drop it all together from my plan. Here are the main things I'm struggling with:

‚Ä¢ I want to go diving so Malapascua, Siquijor and Bohol are on my radar. I think 6 days in Malapascua (including travel to and from Cebu City where I fly into) should be enough time there to get my AOW certification. But how many days should I put aside for Siquijor and Bohol? I also want to do the typical inland attractions on both of these islands. Do you think 3 days on Siquijor (including Apo Island dive from Dauin) and 4 or 5 days on Bohol is enough time? 

‚Ä¢ Siargao looks really nice and I like the look of the lagoon tours, but is it worth flying there and back if I don't surf? I'm not a social person, I don't drink or party. I would spend more time in the north than the south, and I would want to make it worth flying there by spending a good chunk of time, up to a week. Should I just drop it altogether though?

‚Ä¢ I have heard mixed things about Coron and El Nido. Obviously I'd like to see the famous cliffs and beaches and do a couple of boat tours. I could make time to do the 4 days boat trip from one place to the other (I would have to drop Siargao from the itinerary though), but I'm not sure I want to do that if it's a party boat kind of thing, any thoughts on this would be helpful! Also, if I do the multi day boat trip, is it still worth doing other tours in Coron/El Nido, or should I not bother? I was thinking 2 days in Coron and 3 days in El Nido (staying in the Nacpan beach area - can I still do boat tours from here?), and 2 days in Port Barton if I don't do the trip. Or should I just not do Palawan at all because it's so touristy and an instagram hotspot, and put that time towards Siargao, Siquijor and Bohol instead?

‚Ä¢ How much time should I dedicate to Moalboal and the south of Cebu? I thought 3 days is enough time to see the sardines and do a few waterfalls in the area and a sunset hike. 

Order I'm thinking or doing things in to take advantage of cheaper flights in early November:

Cebu - Malapascua - Cebu -‚úàÔ∏è-Coron - El Nido - Port Barton - Puerto Princesa -‚úàÔ∏è- Siargao -‚úàÔ∏è- Cebu - Moalboal - Demuguete - Siquijor - Bohol - Cebu - Manila

I may have overhyped my trip planning skills to her but I really want to do a good job because this will be one of the biggest trips we've taken. We're all from Louisiana, near Baton Rouge and New Orleans. 

My boyfriend and I love hiking, so of course if it were only up to us, we'd hit all the national parks and spend the whole time in them; but my sister and my mom's gf straight up don't enjoy hiking so we've agreed to only one hiking day. My mom's coworker gave Mt Rainier a glowing recommendation so that's where my mom wants us to hike. 

So I was thinking of the highlights of the trip being Mt Rainier, Seattle, then up to Victoria and Vancouver. I've heard great things about Victoria so I'm thinking of probably spending more time there than in Seattle or Vancouver. I haven't really been able to find a whole lot in Seattle that we would enjoy, but I definitely still want to see some of it. 

Nothing at all is set in stone, so I'm really looking for any kind of suggestions, as broad or specific as you want, like how many days to spend where, specific places to check out, or even nearby areas that we'd probably enjoy. I've also considered potentially starting in Portland, checking out Vancouver WA for a day, then driving up to Mount St Helens &amp; checking out the Forest Learning Center &amp; Visitor's center (I really am a huge nerd for nature stuff), then going up to Rainier, Seattle, then Vancouver but that just wouldn't leave much time for Victoria &amp; IDK how the travel logistics would work.

1gc9kb9,Trip Report- 6 Weeks North India,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gc9kb9/trip_report_6_weeks_north_india/,4,"Just got home from a 3 month trip where half of it was in the Northern states of India. The states and regions I visited were Uttar Pradesh, Rajastan, Uttarkhand, and Ladakh. India was at the top of my travel list so was very excited for this country, I‚Äôve seen some very mixed opinions online about India so here was my experience as a solo white man. Also I only exclusively stayed in Hostels and guesthouses. I understand the huge differences between the regions of India so everything I say only applies to the states I visited as I‚Äôve heard the South is a much more pleasant experience.

We‚Äôll start with the highlights:
-Ladakh region as a whole was an absolutely amazing time and should be a must visit. I did a motorcycle ride to Umling La pass, the Markha valley trek, and spent some time in Turtuk in Nubra valley. Leh is a great city as well.
-30 hour train ride from Varanasi to Jodhpur
-Rajastan hitchhiking 
-Vipassana in Jaipur 
-Yoga and meditation in Rishikesh, basic but loved it
-Taj Mahal, went on a rainy day and had the wonder all to myself for the first 30 minutes
-Joeys Hostel in Delhi, great place 
-$1 hostel in Jaisalmer 
-Tibetan monasteries in Ladakh 
-Rajastan forts 

Pros:
-Indian hospitality, in hostels everyone was very friendly, helpful, and talkative. Though sometimes almost too much
-No stealing/pickpocketing 
-Cheap 
-Rich and fascinating culture 
-Trains were a great way to travel
-Easy to find English speakers
-Himalayas
-Lots of police and security 
-Burning ghats of Varanasi 
-Never felt unsafe 
-Decent hostels 
-Never bored walking the streets
-Good weather, missed the rainy season so was mostly pleasant. 

Cons:
-Not a fan of North Indian food, everything seemed too oily and sugary. Prefer South Indian 
-Hostels are sausage fests of Indian men. Very few woman travelers which sucks and if there was they would be in groups/couples. Though can‚Äôt blame them for the stories I‚Äôve heard. 
-Indian social awareness in Hostels, no respect for other guests trying to sleep in rooms. Always turning on the lights, speaking on the phone/to people loudly, and headphones apparently don‚Äôt exist. 
-Child beggars, they like to grab. 
-Noisy all the time, except for Ladakh 
-Smells 
-Poor cooking hygiene 
-Buses don‚Äôt show up/always late
-Auto rickshaw drivers are scam artists, every single one

Shocking:
-Caste system 
-Pollution, yes it‚Äôs that bad. Even the nicest Indians you meet throw their shit out the window expecting a Dalit to pick it up. 
-Treatment of women 
-Racism
-Poverty and treatment of the untouchables
-Varanasi is a shithole and everyone on the street wants to take advantage of you. Cannot recommend to foreigners but Indians seem to like the place.
-Scammers, I avoided every big scam but of course you cannot escape being sold auto/taxi rides and souvenirs at elevated prices. I heard some crazy stories of fellow travelers being scammed. 

Misc Notes:
-Cheap but SEA is still more affordable. 
-Met a lot of extremely adventurous travelers. 
-Few interactions with Indian women, was told they aren‚Äôt allowed to travel by themselves so only met maybe a handful in hostels. 
-High caste Indians, Brahman specifically, can be very rude and condescending 
-Cannot recommend the Moustache hostel chain 
-Left the country being very grateful where I was born
-Seemed most people are surviving, not living
-Food poisoning twice. Never ate street food and was cautious where I ate, I guess not cautious enough haha. I tried to peek in the kitchen and if they were cooking on the ground I would avoid. 
-Satellite gps like a Garmin are illegal, learned that the hard way 
-When available use Ola/Uber 
-I enjoyed Delhi
-Ixigo was great to book trains
-Accommodation reviews by Indians are untrustworthy
-Weird obsession with white skin
-Everyone wants selfies with you, don‚Äôt be afraid to deny it. People will even take selfies/photos of you secretly
-Would not advise solo female travelers to visit unfortunately 

Overall really grateful for my time in India and excited to visit different regions next time. Yes there are many cons, India travel has many highs and lows but it feels rewarding.

1gc7iyr,Travelling to California,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gc7iyr/travelling_to_california/,2,"I‚Äôm planning on travelling to California sometime next year, for the first time ever, to see my long distance partner. I‚Äôm aware how much flights will cost but as for everything else, how much money should I expect having to spend? 
My partner says it‚Äôs fine to just have money for plane and possibly hotel/motel for us that we‚Äôll share costs for and some for food but then they‚Äôll help pay for food and stuff as well as they‚Äôll be working still while I‚Äôm there, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I should save up a lot of money just in case. The plan is to stay for AT LEAST a month, but would prefer I stay for 2, which I could if I‚Äôm able to.

I‚Äôve also considered renting an Airbnb for us but I don‚Äôt really know what to trust or what‚Äôs the best places to look at etc or how it even works. 

As of right now, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay at my partners home, which is why we‚Äôre looking at hotels, but there‚Äôs a small a chance it will change before I visit, but I‚Äôm still unsure on how to go about this.. I have a feeling they‚Äôll be very suspicious at the airport in Cali if I show up with a plan to stay for 1-2 months but not even having money for that whole visit.. 

Any advice? 


Edit: forgot to mention where in Cali. 
It‚Äôll be around LA county, but most likely not inside of LA, but we‚Äôll be staying outside of it and just possibly visit it for some touristy stuff for my sake. 
It‚Äôll most likely be around areas like Covina, San Gabriel, Pasadena. But if we can find cheaper somewhere else nearby, that‚Äôs also an option. 

Edit 2: to all of you who thinks everything‚Äôs a red flag because I‚Äôm not able to stay at their home; life isn‚Äôt just black and white. People end up in situations against their own will sometimes. No they‚Äôre also not married and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping for a divorce‚Äù. 

I asked for tips on figuring out how much money I‚Äôd need towards the visit, not relationship advice. ",52,2024-10-25 18:16:01,LostAndMiserable_,0.53

I am interested in doing this train journey solo in December/January from Laos into China and then onwards into northern Vietnam all by train. Has anyone done it before? I have not yet travelled to China before, but I am very interested in doing so. I have an Armenian passport (visa-free) and an American passport (also visa free now for short visits). I have a few questions...

\- If you have done this trip before on any segment, what was the border crossing like into China from Laos? I have heard some reports they do not search anything upon arrival into China. However, others have told me they search your phone and laptop. Does anyone have experience with this border crossing recently and could you provide me with what your experience was like? 

\- What were your higlights of the route? 

Thanks in advance for your guidance.

I‚Äôm planning a solo 10-day trip to North Vietnam, traveling light with just a 10kg backpack, and I‚Äôve created an itinerary that covers Hanoi, Halong Bay, Sapa, Ha Giang, and Ninh Binh. I‚Äôm flexible but realize this itinerary might be a bit hectic. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice to make it more realistic. Here‚Äôs my current plan:

---

1st: Arrive in Hanoi, clear immigration, and check into a hostel.

2nd: Check out, take a one-day organized tour of Halong Bay cruise. After the tour, catch a bus to Sapa directly, with my backpack.

3rd: Arrive in Sapa around 4 AM, rest on the bus until 6 AM, then start a trek. I‚Äôll leave my backpack in the Sapa center. I will be taking a organized tour with guide for this as well.

4th: Finish the trek by lunch at around 2 PM, and after 3 PM, take the Mount Fansipan cable car. I plan to finish by 6:30 PM, then take an 8 PM bus to Ha Giang after dinner.

5th Nov (3 AM): Arrive in Ha Giang, rest at QT guest house. Begin the Ha Giang 3D2N motorbike loop.

7th midnight: Take a bus to Ninh Binh after finishing the Ha Giang loop.

8th: Visit Hoa Lu, Mua Caves, and Tam Coc in Ninh Binh.

9th: Return to Hanoi, visit the Temple of Literature and take a sunset walk around Hoan Kiem Lake.

10th: Fly back home.

---

Here are my questions:

1. Is this itinerary realistic, considering the overnight bus journeys and tight transitions? Any suggestions on how to adjust it to make it more manageable?

2. On Nov 4th, is it possible to do the Fansipan cable car after completing the two-day trek in Sapa, or is this too ambitious?

3. On Nov 8th, can I realistically visit Hoa Lu, Mua Caves, and Tam Coc after arriving from Ha Giang, or should I take a day tour from Hanoi instead for a more relaxed schedule?

We plan to spend 3 nights in Rome, 2 nights in Orvieto, rent a car and drive to Ponzano Chianti by way of Siena, spend 4 nights in Panzano in Chianti (about 45 min north of Siena and 45 min south of Florence), 2 nights in Bologna (we are going to the F1 race in Imola and it's convenient to bus from Balogna), train to Como for 3 nights, train to Milan and spend the last night in a hotel near the airport.

Wondering if we should swap the 4 nights in Ponzano for 2 each in Sienna and Florence.

We like the option of staying in Ponzano with an amazing view of the countryside if we need a rest rather than hopping from Siena to Florence. We have to drive by Siena to get to Ponzano so we will spend half a day there then and could drive back the next day, or see another nearby town, or ride bikes around the area if we are up for it.

We figure we can drive or bus from Ponzano to Florence for a day trip and then stop again for several hours on our way to Bologna. Not sure if this makes sense or not though.

We don't want to rent more places than necessary because we may need to rest and it costs significantly more to stay in the 2 bigger cities rather than Ponzano. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated.",8,2024-10-20 16:01:32,Ashtanga247,1.0

1g7pp7u,Looking for suggestions for hiking/nature destinations for June 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g7pp7u/looking_for_suggestions_for_hikingnature/,3,"My partner and I are in the early stages of planning a 2-3 week holiday (flying out of Toronto) for next June and I wanted to turn to the wise people of r/travel for any suggestions of destinations we might not have thought of. 

We both like the outdoors and want to ideally do at least one multi-day (3-5 days, let's call it) trek wherever we go OR do a very, very nature oriented trip (such as game drives in sub-Saharan Africa). That being said we both have other criteria that have made finding destination candidates a bit tricky:

- I (and to a lesser extent my girlfriend) do not have a significant interest in the Global North (Canada/US, Western Europe, Australia/NZ, etc.); I've done trips several European countries, within Canada, and to the US in the past and while I enjoyed them, they didn't feel as exciting as travel destinations compared to many of the other places I've been - just my preference, I guess. Eastern Europe is slightly more interesting but not at the top of either of our regions to visit, and we went to South America the past two years in a row so are looking to switch it up from LatAm unless there is a compelling reason to consider otherwise. 

- There are a handful of countries that either one of us has spent enough time in prior to our relationship that it feels hard to justify going back - Iceland, Namibia, Colombia, Thailand, and Morocco I think covers all of them. For personal reasons we also are reserving China and Japan for later trips, so won't be considering them this time around. 

- My girlfriend is slightly more risk averse than I am, so countries like Brazil or Lebanon (even prior to Oct. 7) are intimidating for her and we can probably rule out any regions proximate to active conflicts with risks of being adversely affected like Egypt, Jordan or Kurdistan. We are also both visible minorities and she definitely has (understandable) reservations about visiting countries with reputations for issues with anti-East Asian and anti-South Asian racism. 

- I have pretty serious food allergies to nuts, almost all legumes (including peanuts), soya, and shellfish, which can make eating abroad, particularly in certain regions (like much of Asia) tricky. I don't let it stop me from traveling where I want to go, but it's always nice to go somewhere where the country's entire cuisine doesn't want to kill me. Not a dealbreaker though, I'm happy cooking for myself if it means seeing a new country. 

- My girlfriend struggles with significant heat and humidity. 

- We both enjoy hiking and are in average shape (and committed to training for this trip in June) but due to some back injuries and general difficulties with high altitudes my girlfriend prefers moderately challenging hikes, not hikes that require mountaineering experience or that strain people to their absolute limits. We ruled out Kilimanjaro and the Anna Purna Circuit because of the altitude and / or difficulty level, for example. 

For the purposes of budget let's say we're working with around $5K CAD per person. We are pretty budget oriented when we travel - economy class flights, private rooms in hostels, public transit when possible, etc., etc., classic backpacker stuff, but are open on splurging on ""highlights"" like a few days at an eco-lodge or nature reserve, or guided multi-day trek. 

We're currently considering Malawi, South Africa, Nepal, and Georgia, but like I said at the start, would love other suggestions. We ruled out Vietnam, India (Goa specifically), and Sri Lanka due to those respective countries' climates at the time of year we plan to travel. In the past as a couple, we've really enjoyed Peru, Ecuador, and Senegal, if that helps provide examples of destinations we enjoy. 

Thanks in advance for the tips!",13,2024-10-19 22:18:09,8lbs6ozBebeJesus,1.0
1g7g4tm,"Help filling out AJet refund form (formally AnadoluJet, subsidiary of Turkish Airlines) for reimbursement of flight cancellation",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g7g4tm/help_filling_out_ajet_refund_form_formally/,3,"Earlier this year I had a flight with AJet which ended up being cancelled and after a long process that took months, they approved a reimbursement (based on EC261) which I can use for future bookings with them or refund to my bank account. I opted for the latter and they sent me a form to fill out, which I did and they say they sent the refund but it never showed on my end. I inquired about this asking for some receipt of the transfer and details behind it like a reference number, source bank and account etc, but all they replied with was that something was incorrect.

Normally this would sound like an easy thing to sort out but:

1. they take over a month to reply each time
2. communication skills are the worst I've ever experienced, ex. you can send over a set of short concise questions, and they'll reply with a couple words or a sentence that barely answers just one, and it's also clear they don't speak English and don't care if you never get the refund

I could keep going back and forth with them but this will probably take a year or more to resolve, especially as a Canadian trying to remit the refund to a Canadian bank. I'm trying to figure out what banks work / don't work, which fields to fill out Vs ones that can be left blank, etc

Has anyone else successfully received a refund from them and can share how they filled in the form?

If you have experience doing this with their parent company Turkish Airlines, that might be helpful as well as I assume they require similar info

I've attached the form below for reference:

1gsr9bs,Does this itinerary seem reasonable? Austria in February- Tirol-Vienna; Any feedback welcome on anything,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gsr9bs/does_this_itinerary_seem_reasonable_austria_in/,2,"Hello! 

I am planning a trip to Austria this February. I tend to be quite effusive and to ramble, so I will try to keep this as much to the point as possible for readability (the ‚Äúconsiderations‚Äù section at the end is additional but not necessary context, so feel free to skip that). I appreciate any feedback or insights you may have! I have been to a few places, but find trip-planning very difficult once one veers outside cities. Thank you so much for any help or time you may be able to provide.



Relevant context: 

\-I will be based in Strasbourg, France, so that is where I will be coming from and returning to.

\-I have been to Munich and Salzburg already and plan to do a broader tour of Bavaria (and to visit Budapest) in the spring/early summer

\-I am attending a ball in Vienna, so everything sort of revolves around that

\-I do not have the biggest budget. The trip itself is a huge splurge that I‚Äôve been saving for (especially considering the ball and winter sports), so I will not be able to do expensive meals regularly or any expensive tours unless it‚Äôs something that is extremely worth it/once-in-a-lifetime chance. I will be staying in budget accommodations like hostels, perhaps moving to a hotel a day before the ball to have more privacy as we get ready for it. 

\-I will be traveling solo until Vienna, where my date for the ball should be joining me. 

\-I will be depending on public transportation. 

\-I speak English and French, but am only at Duolingo-level German so far. I hope to take a German language class in Strasbourg, but will still only be at a beginner level.



Strasbourg-Tirol-Vienna-Strasbourg 

Saturday, February 8 (this could potentially be a travel day instead of a prep day): Make sure everything is prepared for trip (pack and get haircut for ball if haven‚Äôt already)

Sunday, February 9: Take 5-ish hour train to Munich- stop in Munich for a bite? 

			Then, 3-ish hour train to Seefeld. 

Monday, February 10: Get rentals, do nordic skiing lesson, and ski the day

Tuesday, February 11: Winter excursion(s), perhaps a hike/toboggan, explore the area.

Wednesday, February 12: More nordic or alpine skiing, perhaps activity later in the day if tired

Thursday, February 13: \~40 min. early train to Innsbruck- explore the city, stay overnight

Friday, February 14: Take a winter hike or some sort of guided tour through the mountains (Achensee?). Explore more of the city if time, stay overnight

Saturday, February 15: \~2-3 hour early train to Salzburg, explore city in winter (see things didn‚Äôt see last time e.g. fortress), stay overnight

Sunday, February 16: \~3 hr train to Vienna. Settle, start exploring the city.

Monday, February 17: Explore city- take a guided tour?, research musical or cultural events, &amp; museum closures

Tuesday, February 18: Day trip? (still researching which would be best in winter)

Wednesday, February 19: Explore city \*2 P.M. FITTING FOR TUX RENTAL\*- must be in city, research musical or cultural events

Thursday, February 20: Day trip? (still researching which would be best in winter)

Friday, February 21: Morning free to explore, get ready for ball, good dinner, ball evening- into early morning! 

Saturday, February 22: relax after ball, take night train back to Strasbourg, or stay the night and do full day of traveling back to Strasbourg on Sunday (\~12+ hrs)

\----------

A few considerations if it helps: 

\-I am not sure how packing will work out as I need to bring things for both a winter trip as well as a city trip. So, I will probably have more luggage than just a backpack- if you have any insight on things I should consider regarding this, I would really appreciate it. Fortunately, I will be renting a tux for the ball, so I don‚Äôt need to worry about that other than footwear. 

\-I got super overwhelmed researching winter activities and regions in Austria as there is no lack of opportunities. I have picked Seefeld for now as I just have to move forward with a plan and solidify accommodations asap. I can alpine ski (would do mostly blues, I loved Les Arcs in France), and have gone nordic skiing only one time- I would like to take a lesson or two while there and do a bit more of this on this trip as opposed to downhill, as well as winter hiking. I am looking for experiencing scenery over sportive/competitive-ness. I love the idea of skiing or hiking from hut to hut and am trying to make that a reality. It seems Seefeld has a lot of options, is scenic, and accessible via public transportation. I am still quite active but not in the best of shape right now due to a couple of injuries that prevented regular exercise over the summer, so I have de-emphasized alpine skiing. Being a novice to nordic skiing, however, I tried to pace the skiing out as opposed to doing it everyday, which I did just fine in Les Arcs a couple years ago. 

\-I love trying regional cuisines and am very interested in regional beer/wine/spirits culture and history (no dietary restrictions). I also love music and traditional folk culture (I am an amateur classical and folk musician). I try to immerse myself as much as I can and to feel like I‚Äôm a part of things when traveling, to find tradition. I am still barely under 30, but am starting to feel my body get older and want to start learning how to plan and take advantage of any excursions in nature as I can. I have no experience in this, but I am good at walking and am regularly active. ",2,2024-11-16 10:43:13,Agitated_Tie4680,1.0

I do have a few quetions that would really just ease my mind leading up to this epic trip. 

We have applied and were issued our Visas for Vietnam. Do I just print out this 1 sheet of paper and bring it with me? It just doesn't feel ""official"" enough to me for some reason.

We plan on getting around via sleeper buses/ trains. I planned on mostly booking these through the website 12Go.com. Seems like a reliable source but open to any other suggestions people might have. This is how we plan to get from HCMC to Phnom Penh. After some research I have seen suggestions to just get Visa on Arrival for Cambodia and others say to get it ahead of time (evisa) I assume we will be fine either way but would love some confirmation of what to do here. Same with Thailand, sounds like we can do visa on arrival. As you can tell, the paperwork and visas weigh on me mostly.

We are planning to do a flight or 2 along the way within Vietnam. (De Nang to HCMC) Any suggestions on airlines or which ones to avoid?

We hardly have any hotels booked. Just our first few days in Hanoi and hope to find places along the way. I understand this is riskier but we don't want to be tied down to a certain itinerary.

One last thing, we wanted to be in Bangkok for New Years and arent sure if we should plan on attending a certain ""party"" or if we should just explore the city and end up wherever. Any suggestions from somebody who has been to Bangkok for New Years would be really helpful.

We love to eat, hike and be in nature while also taking in local culture. Any must do suggestions that anyone has are more than welcome!

1gqisw4,Is there a travel backpack that exists that meets these 2 specific criteria?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gqisw4/is_there_a_travel_backpack_that_exists_that_meets/,2,"
Criteria 1: has a clamshell zipper main compartment opening, with the non-opening side at the bottom of the backpack (i.e., it fully unzips around both sides and the top)

Criteria 2: has bi-directional/2-way luggage handle pass through straps, so that the backpack can go either upright or sideways on a rolling luggage bag.

The 2nd criteria is understandably difficult to find in bags, because it takes more engineering to make it work. I technically found one yesterday - the SwissGear Hybrid Travel Laptop Backpack 21.5 inch, which has the vertical strap for the backpack to go sideways on the rolling luggage, and then it has a horizontal strap at the very bottom portion of the backpack to make it go upright on the rolling luggage. However, the bag won‚Äôt stay on the rolling luggage since it‚Äôs only attached at the bottom. It would need a 2nd horizontal strap at the top to keep it in place (annoyingly, there is a piece of strap fabric at the top but it‚Äôs sewn fully into the bag - so close!).

Anyone know of anything out there? The main purpose of this bag would be as a personal item on airlines for travel within the US.",8,2024-11-13 11:48:13,Existing-Employee631,0.6

I am leaving Canada in January 2025 to explore Mexico and Central America. Below will be a rough itinerary for context, but I am struggling with a budget. I have about $14000 CAD ($10000 USD) saved. This is excluding flights, but will need to include all accommodation, food, transportation, and tours.

**Mexico - Approx. 1 month**

* Mexico City - 1 week
* Puebla- 2 nights
* Oaxaca - 1 week
* Puerto Escondido - 1 week
* San Jose Del Pacifico - 2 nights
* Salina Cruz - 1 night
* San Cristobal - 4 nights
* Palenque - 2 nights
* Merida - 4 nights

**Belize -**

* Caye Caulker - 5 nights
* San Ignacio - 2 nights

**Guatemala - 2-3 weeks**

* Flores - 3 nights
* Stop in Tikal
* Lanquin - 5 nights 
* Lake Atitlan - 5 nights
* Antigua - 5 nights 

**Honduras (to see the ruins)??**

* Copan - 2 nights

**El Salvador - 1 week**

* Santa Ana - 4 nights
* Playa El Tunco - 4 nights

**Nicaragua - 1.5 - 2 weeks**

* Leon - 4 nights

**Panama - 2 weeks**

* Bocas del Toro - 3 nights
* Hornito - 3 nights
* Panama City - 1 night?
* San Blas Islands - 3 nights
* Panama City - 3 nights?

Fly Home

I am hoping to spend roughly $100 CAD ($72 USD) a day. Here is a breakdown:

$25 CAD ($18 USD) for accommodation per day, staying in hostel dorms 

$50 CAD ($35 USD) for food, a combination of street food, restaurants, hostel breakfast &amp; cooking

$15 CAD ($11 USD) for transportation - this seems low with all of the bus travel.

Alcohol may take up the remainder of budget, as I do like the occasional party. 

I do not have tours included in this mess of a budget, as I know each country will fluctuate in cost. This is where any input and advice from you will be helpful.

After that I am planning a Contiki trip around Europe for end of July that is about a month long, but after that I don't know what else I want to do apart from visiting heritage railways, the tattoo festival and just roaming cities. I also plan on getting a youth mobility visa that the UK offers. Budget is in the works but about 5-7g Cdn is the range depending on visas and other expenses before trip. I do have family who live in the UK (mostly in towns north of Edinburgh and some in London), but are second or third cousins and don't want to heavily rely on them. (will stay with them for a few days at most but nothing more than a week).

Looking on advice about groups and stuff to do. I enjoy historical (any era before Cold War, especially early industrial, Victorian, World Wars periods.), cultural, and nature stuff.

Major countries apart from Ireland and UK I would like to visit are: Portugal Spain Italy, Austria , Hungry, Czechia, Switzerland, Benelux region, Berlin, Germany, major cities in Poland, Scandinavia, France . Balkans are a bit iffy for me at the moment (do want do a Romanian/Moldova or a Greek trip as well as visit Istanbul at some point)

Also advice on accommodations would be great. Also any idea on finding work over there would be great also ( I am looking on job board and UK government site) I am willing do labour and kitchen work but also looking into transportation and admin/econ sectors. I have a major in Business admin and minor in economics. Also what visas I need for Europe apart from the new one they are introducing next year.

Also if their are better reddits/blogs for this, send them my way please!

Ps. All of this doesn't have to be one trip, it can be multiple and later in my life. Just want get some ideas of whats possible and whats not.

Edit: While London is a nice place to stay, I am not against living else where. Like Edinburgh, York, Manchester, Cardiff. Also I was raises in a British immigrant household in Canada and enjoy British history and geography so I am not that ignorant about things. ",5,2024-11-12 16:45:12,Jam39813,0.75

Here's what we have so far:

Day 1-3: Fly into Munich and stay 3 nights.

Day 4: Take a morning train to Innsbruck, day trip to Innsbruck, evening train to Salzburg.

Day 5-6: Salzburg, probably one day in the old city and one day in the lakes region. Take evening train on day 6 to Vienna.

Day 7-9: Vienna, take evening train on day 9 to Nuremberg.

Day 9-11: Nuremberg, take train from Nuremberg to Munich airport.

1gooa7s,Photography in Morocco (Marrakesh in particular),https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gooa7s/photography_in_morocco_marrakesh_in_particular/,2,"Hello folks! I'll be heading to Morocco in a couple of weeks, and as a keen hobbyist photographer it's a trip I'm really looking forward to. One of the things I enjoy about travel is the opportunity to capture the daily life of different cultures, which is something I always try to do sensitively to local laws and customs and without invading anyone's privacy. I take no joy from thrusting a camera in people's faces and acting like I'm taking photographs of animals in the zoo.

I try to do a lot of reading into local laws and customs before visiting a new destination with a camera, but Morocco has been quite hard to get a handle on from afar. There are many articles online that describe Marrakech in particular as a very challenging place to take photographs - that people are generally not happy to be photographed, even if they're not the main subject of the scene. There are also Reddit threads and YouTube videos showing people taking all kinds of street photography and not mentioning that anyone took issue with it at all. And legally speaking, it seems to be a grey area - from what I can tell, there is no law against simply taking photographs of people, but it's a criminal offence if one of your photographs is deemed to invade the privacy of its subject or paint them in a negative light.

I wondered if anyone has any recent first-hand experience of photography in Marrakesh in particular but also Morocco more generally, and can speak to any of the above. Obviously if I want a portrait of someone I will ask permission first, but it's not practical to ask everybody in the area whether they mind being in-frame, and my style of photography leans heavily into people being present in the image. Is this likely to be any bother?

If it helps, I'm likely to be carrying a compact mirrorless digital camera that's near-enough silent, as well as a bulkier 35mm film SLR that makes a loud and unmistakable noise. Some advice says ""use a small mirrorless so that people don't notice"" but that makes me a bit uncomfortable - I'm not looking for ways to *get away with* a social or legal faux pas, but rather a way of shooting photographs that aren't going to make people uncomfortable in the first place.

I feel like an old person, but I haven't flown anywhere in quite some time.   
  
I remember there used to be a site where I could just put in destinations (from and to) and see the price for flights for each of the dates. There even was an option to have flight+bus combined, so it would allow for a flight to a different airport and calculate the price of that flight + the bus to your destination. 

If you were young and flexible, you could adjust your vacation based on the price of the flights and I remember scoring many a incredibly cheap flight both to and from places just by waiting a few days up and down. 

I feel like a grandma being unable to find a similarly user-friendly app/website nowadays, does it still exist? If yes, please send me links and names and experience! All is welcome and appreciated, thank you.",9,2024-11-10 14:03:45,xBraria,0.67

Some questions:

Is it better / easier / safer to see the great migration in Kenya, Tanzania, or both? Any important differences between the experience in both countries? Fees, street safety in the important cities, commute from and to airports, etc .

Any tour companies you personally recommend? Is it better or worth bookings some things when you are already there, to get it cheaper? 

I understand the great migration attracts many tourists. What game reserves which might be not as popular as Serengeti or Masai Mara would you recommend?

Is it better to only exchange money at airports, or are there any other exchange places where you get a better exchange rate?

What other things besides the safaris are worth seeing in both countries? I know the beaches are beautiful but please let me know if it's worth visiting them (safety, cleanliness, accomodations).

It's probably worth saying I plan to travel with wife, both 40 years old. Still fit for long walks and waiting times. Also, being from LATAM and having been in South Africa for safaris before, we know how to deal with some safety issues that would scare a European visitor!

1gmmcb0,Slow Travel Taiwan for 3 Weeks - Mid November,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gmmcb0/slow_travel_taiwan_for_3_weeks_mid_november/,2,"Hi Reddit!

We‚Äôll be spending three weeks in Taiwan from November 23 to December 13, right after a three-week road trip through Hokkaido and a week in Kansai. Since we love immersing ourselves in culture, enjoying nature, and savoring street food, we're hoping to make Taiwan a memorable experience.

Our plan so far is to base ourselves in three main regions, allowing for some flexibility and day trips:

# Itinerary Outline:

* **Taipei** ‚Äì 1 week (may shorten to 3-4 days)
* **Tainan** (Western Taiwan) ‚Äì 1 week
* **Taitung and Hualien** (Eastern Taiwan) ‚Äì 1 week

# Travel Style:

My wife, an architect, and I both enjoy cultural and historical activities, scenic hikes, and good street food. We prefer slow travel with plenty of time to explore a region, making it our home base for nearby day trips rather than rushing from one sight to another. Crowded cities are our least favorite parts of travel, though we‚Äôre fine with metro areas that are more spread out and slower-paced. To give an idea, we prefer the laid-back feel of places like Seoul or Mexico City over the hustle of Tokyo or Bangkok.

We‚Äôre not on social media, so for us, it‚Äôs all about the experiences rather than ticking off popular spots.

# Looking for Suggestions On:

* **Day Trips &amp; Must-Sees**: What are the can't-miss places or hidden gems in each of these regions? Any architectural highlights, nature spots, or quiet towns nearby?
* **Avoiding Crowds**: Are there touristy spots we should avoid due to crowds? We‚Äôre okay skipping popular sites if they‚Äôre likely to be too busy.
* **Best Hiking in the East**: We‚Äôve heard amazing things about hiking in Eastern Taiwan. Any specific trails or regions we should prioritize?

# Current Ideas

**Taipei Region** (Short Stay):

* **Day trips to**: Jiufen, Shifen Waterfall, Yangmingshan National Park for nature and some iconic spots outside the city bustle.
* **Exploring neighborhoods**: We‚Äôve heard Dadaocheng and Beitou Hot Springs are worth exploring for a bit of history and relaxation.

**Tainan** (Western Base)

**Taitung &amp; Hualien** (Eastern Base):

* **Best Hiking**: Would love trail recommendations, particularly in Taroko Gorge and anywhere else quieter but equally scenic. 
* **Nature Day Trips**: The Rift Valley sounds amazing‚Äîany particular spots to focus on?

Any suggestions on other regions worth adding or if our current plan might need tweaking would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for helping us shape this trip!",2,2024-11-08 10:19:46,ShuanYu,0.75

We had taken off with one hour delay. 2 hours into the flight, the pilot announces that they have to return to the original departure airport due to unspecified reasons. Turns out a drunk man was being disruptive.

Once we land and the man is arrested, they cancel the flight, without any accomodation, siting that they cant fly more than 14 hours with the crew and do not have hotels to book at this point.

I had to be back in London as I have a son to take care of, so I booked an alternative flight directly throught their website immediatelly. That flight was confirmed and i was able to check in.

In the same process, BA put me on another flight, which arrives later, I did not accept the proposed new flight as I already booked a new one. 

Note that the initial booking was done via my company's booking agent (Navan) and they initiated the refund request of the original flight.

Instead of landing at 2pm on the 28th, I landed at 730am on the 29th.

--- 

Things I'd love to ask is; 

1. Is there a night bus from San Gil to Bogota? I considered flying to Armenia from San Gil but it feels like we'd lose a whole day travelling to Bucaramanga, the flight, then another flight. So perhaps a better use of time to travel to Bogota in the evening and fly out the next day?
2. Are we broadly spending too much time in Salento/Filandia? I'm thinking perhaps I could cut down a day here but wondering where to add it onto if any has any advice. 
3. I'm also thinking perhaps it could be worth flying to Palomina after work on Day 3 instead so I have one full day in Bogota? And then I'd still have time to chill in Palomina as we wouldn't need to be in Riohaca till the evening.
4. Generally what do people think? The one thing I'm sad about is not getting time in Medellin but unfortunately just not sure how to squeeze it in!

So I wonder if anyone know about getting the transit visa at the border directly? To cross Algeria in about 2/3 days from the border to Oran to get the boat there.

Thanks a lot!

1glf61i,South East Asia 3 month itinerary check,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1glf61i/south_east_asia_3_month_itinerary_check/,2,"	Hey everyone! I'll be traveling for about 5 months this spring with three months in SEA. This is going to be my first (and likely only) long-term solo trip and I've got a lot planned. I'm planning on visiting Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. I'm worried that my itinerary is a bit too packed, although I do usually prefer to do as much as I can with the time I have.

I'm wondering if adding Indonesia is a bit too much and those days might be better allocated elsewhere. However I like mountains more than beaches and cities, and I will be hiking the three passes trek in Nepal at the end of April, so climbing mountains in Indonesia would be a good way to get into shape.

I also know I have my itinerary a lot more planned out than a lot of people, but it's somewhat necessary because I will have friends flying out to join me for some parts of the trip, so I will need to meet them at specific locations and dates.

Tldr; is this schedule way too rushed, and am I missing anything? I like mountains (especially ones I don't need to hire a guide for) and saving money

I am going to Brazil for c. 10 days and my itinerary was the following:

\- 3 days in Rio

\- 4-5 days in Manaus to go to a travel lodge in the Amazon

\- 3-4 days to go to Len√ßois Maranhenses

However, it seems that the conditions are not the best at the moment.

\- Is it worth at all going to Len√ßois Maranhenses at the moment? I've been dreaming about those lakes but don't want to lose days flying there if there is no water at all. Any thoughts?

\- I saw the droughts in the Amaon. How are the lodge stays from Manaus at the moment? Are they still operating normally?

Planning to take a 1 week solo vacation to Amsterdam/Netherlands on March 2025 during my birthday week. Anyone here have recommendations for accommodations? 

I found a few hotels so far, but would love to hear what you guys recommend for a week. I will most likely go to other nearby cities as well, however that'll most likely be a day trip (but I might decide for an overnight stay depending on itinerary)

1. Hotel Fogo (recommended by my colleague, however he stayed for only a few days)

2. Correndon Apartments Amsterdam Schipol Airport (nearby to the airport with decent prices, and with the free airport shuttle lol)

I don't have a ""huge"" budget but I don't mind spending a decent amount, since my flight will mostly be paid with my points.

Flights are already covered, so this amount is just for accommodation, food, transportation, and activities.

**Note**: In Chile and Argentina we won't be travelling below Santiago or Buenos Aires, so only north Chile and north argentina, as I don't think our budget will be enough to explore the south!

**Here‚Äôs our route:**

‚Ä¢¬†**Bolivia**: La Paz, Uyuni Salt Flats, Sucre, Santa Cruz

‚Ä¢¬†**Argentina**: Northern regions, then Buenos Aires (just briefly)

‚Ä¢Staying in hostels, budget Airbnbs, or sharing rooms to save costs

‚Ä¢Cooking our own meals when possible, but also exploring local cuisine

‚Ä¢Taking buses rather than flights between destinations, if feasible

I haven't done much traveling. But I'm in my mid late 30s so no partying for me. I don't have much time to research as I normally would since I work 50 hours a week as a nurse in Canada. So I'm desperate for help.

After some researching I've done, this is what I've got. I'm looking for input to see if I should change something. I don't like to jampack my day as I like to see new things/food but also be relaxed.

\- **Food is important**. I want good food but reasonable budget. Maybe one meal a day where I'll splurge $20-40 USD and the rest of the meals for that day is light snacks (ie. pizza, bagel, etc) or something affordable. **Definitely pizza and bagels at one point.**  
\- My must sees is what I plan to see on a particular day. And the rest I'd be fine not seeing/doing if I decide day of I don't want to or I'd rather do something else.  
\- I'm staying in Midtown  
\- I'm fine walking. If it's going to take me 20 minutes to walk, I don't mind. Especially if taking the bus takes 30. I walk pretty fast. With that said.. I also don't mind paying a premium for Uber for I presume in NYC, the traffic will kill me?  
\- I'm open to paying to go up Statue of Liberty. And paying for things as I probably won't be back to NYC for a while.  
\- I've traveled once and it was to Europe. I really enjoyed museums. I tend to enjoy anything new.   
\- I want to buy a used book somewhere. I guess it doesn't really matter where. But if there's a special mention, please do so.

* Day 1 Friday
   * Arrive JFK Airport at 7am 
   * Hotel at Midtown (drop off carry-on)
   * **Times Square (my must see)**
      * Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch
      * I was thinking visit in AM first before seeing at evening?
   * **Central Park (my must see)**
   * The Met Museum
      * Maybe do this on Day 2?
   * **Saint Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral (my must see)**
   * Rockefeller Center
* Day 2 Saturday
   * **Grand Central Station (my must see)**
   * **Empire State Building (my must see)**
   * Chinatown or Korean Town
      * Is it worth it to eat somewhere here? I do love KBBQ. 
   * Union Square
      * Buy used book here? Wherever I travel, I like to buy a used book
   * **Broadway at 8pm (tickets bought)**
* Day 3 Sunday
   * **I bought tickets to watch the Giants game at 1pm. Does this day look right or should I be doing something else?** 
   * Financial Distsrict
   * 9/11 Memorial
   * **Statue of Liberty (my must see)**
      * **Going up is a must for me.** Anything I should know about?
   * Evening
      * Bar? Comedy show? Broadway show?
      * I‚Äôd like to see a dubstep show (lol). But tbh, I‚Äôd be fine not going. Considering I am going to a Broadway show already at 8pm and I‚Äôd rather sleep after Lol. I‚Äôm in my 30s.
* Day 4 Monday
   * **Brooklyn Bridge (my must see)**
   * West Village
      * Buy slice of pizza here somewhere as per my friend
   * Chelsea Market

There's a few places I haven't included as I am not sure which day to see it. I know I want to see the Rockefeller Building too but I presume that's a ""go and see and leave in 10 minutes"" or am I wrong? What else should I be adding? And what else should I be removing, in your opinion (and why)?

1gkoanc,Northern Vietnam Itinerary for February ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gkoanc/northern_vietnam_itinerary_for_february/,2,"Hi everyone!

We are visiting northern Vietnam February 18th through March 2nd. We are interested in experiencing the vibrant culture, seeing the countryside and beautiful scenery, and of course eating all the amazing food. We won't be driving our own motorbikes, but happy to do some bicycling and moderate hiking. We want to go at a relatively relaxed pace. We are mid-range travelers in terms of budget, mostly looking to be comfortable, but also willing to splurge a little. I've rewritten our itinerary so many times. The more I read about Hoi An and Sapa, I'm not sure we want to spend so much time traveling to them. Hoi An may be a bit too tourist trappy, and it sounds like February is not a good time of year for Sapa. So I'm now considering the following itinerary and would appreciate any insight you guys have!

Specific questions: 
1. Does this itinerary leave enough time at each place? Is there too much or too little time at any of these places?
2. Is Mai Chau a good alternative to Sapa at that time of year?
3. Is a Bai Tu Long Bay cruise recommended? We are under the impression it is a beautiful and much quieter alternative to Ha Long Bay.
4. Does it make sense to do both Bai Tu Long Bay and Ninh Binh? Will that be slightly repetitive in terms of limestone scenery and should we choose just one? 
5. Are we making a mistake skipping Hoi An, and/or Sapa?

Day 1 - Hanoi

Day 2 - Bus or van to Ninh Binh

Day 3 - Ninh Binh

Day 4 - Bus or private car to Mai Chau 

Day 5 - Mai Chau

Day 6 - Mai Chau 

Day 7 - Bus or van to Hanoi

Day 8 - Bai Tu Long Bay cruise (considering Dragon Legend)

Day 9 - Bai Tu Long Bay cruise 

Day 10 - Bai Tu Long Bay cruise/back to Hanoi

3) Day at a theme park in Anaheim.. I know it would be busy but we may do 1 day on the way to Palm Springs if the itinerary makes sense.

My wife and I are headed to Scotland next week and I wanted to run my itinerary by some smarter folks than me. A few things to help with context: we did an Ireland road trip at the same time last year and were fine with the amount of driving.

  
**Day 1:** Arrive in Edinburgh, drive to Glenshee area just outside Cairngorms National Park to stay the night.

**Day 2:** Depart Glenshee and head to Braemar Castle to take in a view and then go for a hike in Cairngorms, likely somewhere on the west side to split up driving. Spend the night in the Fort Augustus area.

**Day 3:** Depart Fort Augustus early and make our way to Portree stopping at Urquhart Castle and Eilean Donan along the way. Ideally get to Portree by early afternoon so we can get at least one sightseeing/activity in before nightfall. Spend the night in Portree.

**Day 4:** Full day on Isle of Skye doing all the things we missed the previous day. Spend the night in Portree again.

**Day 5:** Depart Portree and make our way to Fort William - perhaps take the ferry/long way so we can see the Glenfinnan Viaduct. Spend the night in Fort William.

**Day 6:** Day trip/sight see/hike/TBD. Spend the night in Fort William.

**Day 7:** Depart Fort William and head to Edinburgh Airport to drop the car and head to the city center. Goal is to be in the city center by noonish and spend the day doing Edinburgh things. Spend the night in Edinburgh.

**Day 8:** Full Edinburgh tourist day. Spend the night in Edinburgh.

**Day 9:** Depart from Edinburgh Airport in the AM.

2. Is Habarana or Dambulla a better place to stay as a base to visit locations around? It seems accommodation is plenty everywhere. Are these cities very different in nature?
3. Are national parks (Yala, Udawalawe) easier to reach from Ella or Mirissa as a day trip? Or is it a better option to stay overnight close to the parks? Distances seem manageable, I find it however difficult to decide. I have enough time to manage it either way, but I would prefer to minimize checking in and out of accommodations every couple of days.

To sum up my likes/dislikes:  
\- I'm in my early 40s so not really interested in night life and beach clubs but more quiet places  
\- I like good food options but eat mostly vegetarian  
\- I love a nice beach and swimming  
\- snorkeling is cool but I do not do diving  
\- I like photogenic spots and views as I take my camera/drone everywhere  
\- some hiking is good but not my primary plan as I travel with only carry-on and as such don't have the space for clothes for colder heights  
\- not that much into wildlife, more for nature

I also do not have a motorbike licence so I have to use public transport/taxis/private drivers (which can add up quite fast so I'd like to avoid as much as possible)

1) Vietnam (end of February to either end of March or middle of April)  
  
After I finish my 3 month trip in Thailand I plan to stay 1 month in Da Nang (as an avid gym goer I'd like to stay put for the whole month since in the next 2 months it will be quite difficult to get my workouts done).  
  
I will do some 1 or 2 day trips to Hoi An and Hue.  
Any other suggestions to visit that are close to Da Nang?

After Da Nang I can either fly directly to Hanoi and spend a 2-3 days there exploring it before I fly to Indonesia.   
Or extend for another 7-10 days and explore some more with more time in Hanoi.

Places I have looked at are (staying 1-3 days in each):  
\- Phong Nha (2 nights) - maybe since it's on the way but not sure yet  
\- Ninh Binh (3 nights)  
\- Ha Long Bay or Lan Ha (looking mostly at 1 day tours from Hanoi)   
\- Hanoi (3-4 nights)  
  
Open to other suggestions.

2) Indonesia (2-3 weeks - starting either end of March or from middle of April)

I'm looking at Java and Sulawesi.  
I've been to Bali, Lombok, Gili islands and Nusa Lembongan this April so I'd like to explore other places

Deciding if it is better to take more time and stay only on Java for good 2 weeks or extend my Indonesia trip to 3 weeks and make it around 10 days Java and 10 days Sulawesi.

Rough itinerary for Java and Sulawesi;

Java:  
\- Jakarta (1-2 nights)  
\- train to Bandung (2-3 nights)  
\- train to Yogyakarta (3 nights)  
\- train Malang (3-4 nights) - want to explore Tumpuk Sewu waterfall and hike the Mount Bromo for the sunrise

Sulawesi:  
\- Makassan  
\- Leang Petta Kere  
\- Tanah Toraja  
\- Tentena  
\- Togian islands or Banggai islands (I might skip all of these since I'm off to Philippines for the beaches and swimming - what do you think)  
  
3) Philippines (good 2 weeks from beginning of May)

Land in Puerto Princesa

\- Puerto Princesa (1 night)  
\- Port Barton (2 nights) - relaxing beach time  
\- El Nido (2-3 nights) - relaxing and do one of the island hopping tours  
\- boat tour (3D2N probably) to Coron  
\- flight to Cebu  
\- Sumilon island (day trip)  
\- Siquijor (3-4 nights)  
\- Panglao island (2-3 nights)  


4) Vietnam  
I fly from Cebu to Ho Chi Minh (since I already have my return ticket from there) and explore for a couple of days before returning home.

So is this to optimistic/rushed?   
Anything skippable or worth adding?

Open to all suggestions :)

My boyfriend and I are planning a trip to Japan for late next year, and we‚Äôve put together a rough itinerary. We‚Äôd love your thoughts and suggestions to make it even better! Here‚Äôs what we have so far:

Day 1: Travel Day (Flight from the US to Tokyo)

Days 2-4: Tokyo

Days 8-11: Kyoto or Osaka (Train from Hakone to Kyoto/Osaka on the morning of Day 8)

Days 12-15: [Open to suggestions!]

Day 16: Travel Day


For our last destination, we‚Äôre hoping to go somewhere with beautiful beaches, hiking, waterfalls, and other outdoor activities. Any recommendations on where we could spend these last few days? We‚Äôre open to reversing our itinerary if it makes sense to end in Tokyo instead.

We‚Äôre also considering skipping Hakone due to high hotel costs. Would it be worth a visit, or should we look elsewhere? If we do go to Hakone, we‚Äôd like to take a day trip to Oshima Island. Is this recommended, or should we focus on other nearby experiences? Additionally, is Mount Fuji worth visiting, or would you suggest a different experience altogether?

Some other details:

Kyoto vs. Osaka: Should we prioritize one over the other?

Island trips and day trips: From our final destination, would day trips to islands like Yakushima be worthwhile?


We're skipping Okinawa due to distance and would rather not take any internal flights, so any alternatives that are accessible by train would be ideal.

We are considering spending two nights in Skye (thinking somewhere like Kinloch Lodge) and we are willing to splurge for a nice stay. However, I know that the days are significantly shorter in November and weather can be very hit-or-miss, so wondering if anyone who's visited at this time of year can chime in on whether it would be worth the money/time to visit? 

We are both active, love to hike and walk, love wildlife, and don't mind rain (as long as it's not raining sideways for hours on end). Seems like most of the top sights/hikes (Old man of Storr, Quirang, Cave of gold, Eilean Dolan castle, etc) are between 30min-1hr drive away from Kinloch Lodge.

FYI, if we chose not to visit Skye this time, we'd likely re-allocate the time to more days in and around Edinburgh, or pay a visit to somewhere like [Glenapp Castle](https://glenappcastle.com/?_gl=1%2A1evo12v%2A_gcl_aw%2AR0NMLjE3MjM0MzcxMDYuQ2owS0NRand3dUcxQmhDbkFSSXNBRldCVUMwdTdMR2lwNE9yX2MzckNTM0RiWHNFaDBuUHBQbG9UZTBCYnlXRVhqRkc5WFctczBReEd4QWFBZzhURUFMd193Y0I.%2A_gcl_au%2AMTkxODMxODkyOC4xNzMwMDY2MzU4%2A_ga%2AMzkzMjM5NjYwLjE3Mjk3MzMwOTY.%2A_ga_EQXEQCV7TK%2AMTczMDA2NjM1NC4yLjEuMTczMDA2NjQxMy4xLjAuMA) in Ayrshire for those same two nights.

I'm a Taiwanese passport holder, and trying to apply for a tourist visa to visit Syria in November. I plan to enter Syria through the Jordanian border, departing from Amman and arriving in Damascus by bus (as getting a Lebanese visa is extremely troublesome and difficult for Taiwanese citizens).

I have already submitted the application on the online portal and paid for it - but when the system asked for a host (or sponsor as some tour operators word it), I thought it meant my accommodation information, so I filled in the contact information of a hotel. After a short conversation with a local who currently lives in Syria, he mentioned that he encountered quite some tourists who did the same, but all of them failed to get the visa application approved.

I've been searching online, only to find out that Syrian embassies and consulates stopped issuing visa (for those who are applicable for eVisas) after the country introducing the eVisa system, so I can't apply for a visa through any physical offices. Also, the tour operators I checked only assist guests who are attending their group tours, both for eVisa applications and the security clearance paper for visas on arrival.

As a result, I am wondering if anyone got this sorted. Has anyone applied for (or heard about applying for) the eVisa with hotel information and succeded? Or, does someone know any trustable individuals or tour operators could be used as a host in the eVisa application? Of course, I am willing to pay a fee for such service.

November 23 (Saturday): Fes

November 24 (Sunday): Fes (Day trips to Meknes/ Volubilis)

November 25 (Monday): Fes

So it‚Äôs about 12 days with travel.

Any thoughts? Should I stay a night in Tangier or Casablanca? Should I stay an extra night in Chefchaouen? Should I spend less days in Fes and more in Marrakech?

My boyfriend and I (early 20s) want to go to Portugal in early March. We like a lot of nature (hiking too), but also some museums, culture, bars in the evening (no clubbing) etc. We also are foodies, so love to go to nice restaurants or have street food. We don‚Äòt really want to go too far south, we do want to stay along the coast, and we will rent a car.

Our current (rough) plan is this:

Day 1 &amp; 2: Porto (maybe with day trip to Sintra)
Day 3: Douro Valley, maybe with a wine tour
Day 4 - 6: Lisbon, with maybe a day trip to coastal regions around the city
Day 7: Sleep somewhere in the National Park region by Zambujeira do Mar
Day 8: Go back to Lisbon
Day 9: Go to Porto and fly back from there

I know its not ideal to go all the way back up again for the flights, but unfortunately we already booked those. Day 1 is basically a full day because we arrive early in the morning. We don‚Äôt speak Portuguese and will be flying in from another EU country.

Currently booked to stay in Ixelles in Brussels (but debating swapping out closer to Grand Place since we're there such a short time). Hotel in Ghent is refundable because I'm not 100% sold we should stay there vs. Bruges, or even if we should go elsewhere to see WW2 sites in Belgium.

Aside from Brussels and Amsterdam, we will keep our luggage stored in train station lockers.

**Day 1**  **- Brussels**

* Arrive in Brussels AM, drop off luggage at hotel, each brunch, walk around grand place, check into hotel
* Dinner options TBD, but would prefer something low key

**Day 2 - Brussels**

* Magritte museum in AM, lunch options TBD. Concert in the evening

**Day 3 + 4 - Bruges / Ghent**

* We have a hotel booked in Ghent, but on the fence which we should stay at as base
* Mostly planning on checking out food, Gravensteen, Belfry, St. Bavo's, and overall walking around

**Day 5 - Antwerp stop**

* Reservations for lunch at Zilte - since it's a trek to go from Ghent to here then Amsterdam afterwards our day is primarily just the lunch and walking around Antwerp and transit

**Day 6 - Amsterdam**

* Anne Frank House (we're aware to book tickets in advance)
* Brunch in Jordaan/walking around
* Canal cruise
* Dinner reservations at Cafe de Klepel

**Day 7 - Amsterdam**

* Van Gogh museum in AM (will book tickets in advance)
* Lunch TBD
* Moco museum
* Dinner reservations at Choux

**Day 8 - Day trip to The Hague?**

* Would visit Mauritshuis &amp; Escher museum, maybe have dinner here

**Day 9 - Amsterdam**

* Maybe Rijksmuseum
* Dinner at Cafe de Klepel
* Concert

Fly back home in AM.

Would love any recommendations re: food, if we should look elsewhere instead of Ghent/Bruges, and if any of these things seem too packed or we could add more things to do. I'm always reluctant to pack the days too much in case a nap or downtime is needed.

I do like museums, but in general we kind of fly through them and ""skim read."" In general, I prefer modern art or ancient relics over classic paintings. Also debated checking out Foam.

We're not precious about anything in the schedule outside of Anne Frank house, the scheduled concerts, and good food.",9,2024-10-26 19:58:17,throwaybeauty,1.0

They are now gone forever. Customer service WILL NOT help you and will refuse to do anything for you if you were unlucky enough to lose your bags. They refute any liability for baggage and will basically tell you to go fuck yourself. 

i went on a trip last week and my partner and I didnt get informed of a random bus transfer at the Chicago station. Driver told us we'd be getting back on the bus at a different gate and said NOTHING about a transfer. Ticket did not list it as one either. Now all of our belongings are presumably stolen by either the employees or sitting in a lost and found god knows where with absolutely no one at greyhound willing to help. Essentially every route we take to locate them tells us to fuck off and ""we arent liable for any lost baggage."". Maybe if we had been told by ANYONE that bags were supposed to be tagged at a station we might have been contacted about them, but that didnt happen. 

Absolutely fucking infuriating business practices and thats not even mentioning all the loud teenagers actively harassing people the whole trip and smoking weed and drinking the whole way. Avoid greyhound like it's an STD. Worst week of my fucking life. ",0,2024-10-26 13:51:42,SaibaSloth,1.0
1gcqkiu,"Lost baggage, different airlines",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gcqkiu/lost_baggage_different_airlines/,2,"So I have a situation in which I flew Dublin-Lisbon-Boston on TAP Portugal on 10/24, and my checked piece didn‚Äôt arrive in Boston. I filed a claim with the agent at that time. I then flew home from Boston to St. Louis on Delta. TAP Portugal doesn‚Äôt operate in St. Louis.

I was told I have the option to either collect the bag at STL airport, or have it shipped to my house, which I opted to pick it up at the airport as I was trying to minimize the number of failure points. I have yet to hear anything back at all from TAP Portugal, about 48 hours later. I can see through TAP‚Äôs baggage tracker that the bag was sent to Boston on TAP‚Äôs flight on 10/25, but from there I am unable to further track it.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has experience with this type of situation. At this point, if the bag really is sent to STL airport, would it be on another airline entirely? Since TAP doesn‚Äôt operate in STL, I‚Äôm concerned from this point how I will be able to track progress if I continue to not hear from TAP.

I really need your input to plan my two week vacation during the first two weeks of december. I am a resident physician and have a vacation after almost 13 months. I am a single guy living in Connecticut. I would like any recommendations - I mostly want to relax and maybe party a bit.

After that I plan on flying to Miami for 4 days where I mainly want to party since I have never been (Fri-Mo). I intend to fly to Chicago and Iowa after that to meet a couple of friends (Tu-Fri) and then flying back to NYC (Fri-Sat) and then back to CT.

I do not have any family in the US and I am ok to do any kind of vacation. Do you have any other recommendations or any changes to this plan that you would recommend.",8,2024-10-26 11:53:34,thehalo_01,0.64

For my whole life I have been wanting to book a one way ticket to South America from New Zealand, and go travelling for an indefinite time period. This could be from a few months to a year depending on enjoyment/how quickly I run out of money.

I am getting to the point where I have saved up enough and plan to quit my job, and book a ticket to Colombia in the new year. I understand that New Zealanders can visit for 90 days without a visa, but are required to show proof of exiting (i.e. return flights) and proof of funds.

Does anyone know how this works if I just plan on travelling out of Columbia to Ecuador for example, rather than flying home? How much money do they expect you to have upon entry to these places? I plan to travel really slowly and cheaply to get my money to last as long as possible, within reason of course.
What would you suggest for travel insurance in case of medical emergencies if I end up travelling for a long time?

If anyone has any stories of similar trips I'd love to hear them as well :)

Thanks

My wife is Punjabi and speaks Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu. Between the two of us I hope the language situation is handled! What I was hoping for help with is regarding our itinerary and how realistic it is and also questions regarding luggage. 

Our plan is to land in Delhi on March 15th with my parents.   
March 15th to 20th -- Delhi x 2 days, Agra x 1 day, Jaipur x 1 day  
March 21st - Fly to Kochi   
March 21st to 29th - Spent in Kerala seeing family but also two nights in Cochin and two nights in Tiruvanthapuram (Spent with Parents)

After this point we will separate from my parents and we plan to travel just us two. A general route I had in mind was:

Kerala --&gt; Goa via train

Goa --&gt; Mumbai via train

Mumbai --&gt; Varanasi via Plane

Varanasi --&gt; Delhi via Train

Delhi --&gt; Punjab (Amritsar and Chandigarh) 

Punjab --&gt; Dharamshala 

Dharamashala --&gt; Delhi then fly back to Canada 

Would love insights into:

1. We'd love to see Rajasthan and Jaisalmer but I'm not sure if that is possible in our itinerary-- any advice on this?

2. Regarding luggage-- is it fairly easy to find places to leave a checked suitcase on trains or should we be aiming to go entirely backpack? I know we can store the suitcases at most guest houses and rooms generally speaking.

Open to any thoughts or ideas - TIA! 

- Early 30s, experienced travelers who are huge foodies (LOVE Vietnamese cuisine and everything from street food to Michelin level dining) 

- willing to spend for a little more luxury (private cars, premium spa experiences, etc) especially for accommodations so open to any suggestions if an incredible hotel is worth visiting a particular location for

- We will be spending ~2 weeks in Thailand (some cities, some beaches) before and flying directly from Thailand 

- I have already visited Hanoi, HCMC (incl Cu Chi tunnels), and Halong bay in a prior visit and would not like to repeat, other than maybe 1-2 days in Hanoi for traveling in / out

- Generally hoping to avoid long car / train / bus rides over ~5 hours

- We enjoy light hikes (easy, 1-2 hours) but are not intense outdoorsy people

I initially wanted to do central Vietnam (Hoi An, Da Nang, etc) but it looks like that‚Äôll be risky in terms of weather. The Ninh Binh / Tam Coc region is also high on the list but everywhere up further North (Sapa, Ha Giang) seems to involve long bus travel.

We have been in Europe for 2 months and long story short, we recently came into a bit of money and wanted to treat those we love so we‚Äôre bringing home a lot of souvenirs. 

The logistics of heading back is that we fly out of Rome. We will land in London for a layover, however, since we will have checked bags and have to change airlines we will have to leave security and customs and recheck in for our next flight. From there we fly back to the United States, specifically JFK. 

For important information on the items we‚Äôre bringing back, it will be 6 leather purses, 3 bottles of liquor, 1 bottle of win, a handful of airplane bottles of liquor, 3 knives, and after that it‚Äôs simple Knick knacks, t shirts and soccer jerseys. We estimate the cost of everything at about $1500.

With that info here is what we are trying to figure out and any help is greatly appreciated: 

1. Do we have to declare anything for the UK? Reading their customs instructions were confused. Since we‚Äôre getting right back on a plane and not staying, and since their declaration limit of goods is very high we are not sure if we have to declare or not. If we do have to declare since we are leaving customs and security for a moment, do we have to declare anything or just some stuff? 

2. Will the knives be a problem in the U.K.? They will be in my checked luggage, bubble wrapped in a box. They are mostly decorative but are quite large. 

3. In the U.S. I have read you don‚Äôt really need to declare things like t shirts and Knick knacks. What do you recommend I declare? All of it or some of it? 

4. The U.S. limit before taxes is $800 PER PERSON. So if we have all souvenirs in one large suitcase and the total does not exceed $1600 does that mean my wife and I are good because we both get $800? 

5. Finally, we did not save all of our receipts. I can go back in my credit card statement and randomly assign charges but to be honest most are in foreign languages and I have no idea.

1ga0r76,Portugal Feb 12 day Itinerary,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ga0r76/portugal_feb_12_day_itinerary/,2,"Planning to head to Portugal this Feb. Not planning to rent a car since path is pretty straight and likely going solo. Here's my plan:

Flying into Lisbon

Lisbon (5 nights)

\- Sintra

Coimbra (1 night)

Averio (1 night)

Porto (5 nights)

\- Duoro (?easier with car)

Flying out of Porto

Any suggestions on cities/experiences to add/subtract? 

Would plan to do Evora + Algave during a later trip via rental car as I want to visit Andalusia again and it would fit nicely together. 

Feel like with this itinerary a car isn't necessary, but open to suggestions on that + any cities I should tack on or cool experiences along the way. I read about Nazare but more into history/food/architecture, could be nice in the summer when I come back. Obidos piqued my interest as well.

Flying into Lisbon the morning on the 14th and flying out early on the 24th. Currently planning on doing Lisbon, Azores (Sao Miguel), and Porto. Please give us any recommendations for day trips, but here is how our trip looks as of now, and some things we might be interested in. If you have any advice on these things, or other reocmmendations please let us know!

  
Lisbon 14th-16th

Azores 16th-19th

Porto 19th-22nd

Lisbon 22-24th as we fly out early in the morning.

This gives us 2 FULL days in each of the places, with a travel day into each, and a possible flex day on the back end (IE if we enjoy Porto a lot, we stay the 22-23rd there, or travel back for another day in Lisbon), but otherwise about half days with the travel.

Some day trips we may be interested in are:

Porto: Wine trip to the Duoro Valley

Lisbon: Trip to Sintra to see the Pena castle and explore the area

Please critique our trip, and let us know of ANY other suggestions or places please pass along. I know the Azores is a bit of a trip from the mainland, but this was our initial inspiration to travel to Portugal so we feel like we need to go with our gut and venture out there.

Pretty much yearly over the last 5 years I have gone to Waikiki and rented an Airbnb 2 blocks from the ocean.  I'd like to switch it up, beaches, snorkeling, pretty stuff, that's my thing! To give you an idea if why Waikiki all these years: 

I know Waikiki is crowded and people like to bag on it...but it is an amazing homebase to get around the island if you just leave before traffic. I'm not a bars and restaurants guy, so the convenience of having such amazing food trucks there also is a plus.  I really love just walking to the beach every evening and watching the sunset, bobbing around in the ocean...and then walk through the crazy, but overall very clean and safe city.  I like that there are whale tours available and surf lessons as well.  Freaking love the botanical gardens.  The availability of things to do is amazing, I could write a book haha 

I've done Maui as well but I didn't find it as accessible by foot, I did not stay at a resort, though.  Too much driving to get anywhere. The whales there were nuts, though! I've been to Cabo and Cancun...but not really looking to make the return trip.  I'm not against somewhere else in Mexico, but it would have to be compelling.  Not feeling the desert

I live in the NW US so it makes traveling over here easier.  I would consider Cook Islands, something like that, but would burn so much time traveling.  Any suggestions?",2,2024-10-21 16:58:23,spgvideo,0.75

Earlier This year I was in Portugal, Ireland, Italy, czech, Iceland, and Nicaragua from jan-April. We did a lot of hiking and surfing. I would go back to different European country or a different central/ South American country. I also spent 3 months in Costa Rica in 2023 so Im not rushing to go back their either at the moment. The only country I‚Äôd want to go back to out of those rn would be Portugal. I LOVED hiking in Madeira! 

It Doesn‚Äôt have to be a cool weather place, that‚Äôs just what I like for hiking conditions personally. Or if it‚Äôs in the USA tell me as well!

Even though it is the first time we have visited the Yucatan, having read many of your forums, we have decided to avoid all the super tourist destinations if possible... we will arrive in Cancun with the evening flight, so obviously an overnight stay in Cancun is almost a must being that we will be tired from the flight and would not want to get into the car straight away on the first night.  
  
Our idea was to do for example Cancun - Valladolid (therefore chichen and ek balam) - Merida (therefore Progreso and Uxmal), going down towards Chiapas (agua azul, san cristobal, tuxla, yaxchilan, palenque), and then going up and last days (tulum, isla mujeres, holbox, rio lagartos..)  
  
Can it be done in 17 days? Would you change anything? Would you also add a touch in Guatemala? (Atitlan, Tikal, Chichicastenago)?",6,2024-10-19 06:52:01,No_Rutabaga_2843,0.67

I'm planning a trip with a buddy to Cambodia/Vietnam and trying to decide between 2 routes.  Of course I'm also open to other suggestions too!

  
We arrive in PP on Jan 22, and depart from HCMC on Feb 18.   We definitely want to stay at an Elephant sanctuary - planning for Elephant Valley Project (EVP) - and also to spend some time in/around Siem Reap.   We also want to spend some time in some cool chilled-out spots, preferably with less tourists. 

Potential routes: 

(1)  PP -&gt; Siem Reap -&gt; EVP -&gt; Dak Lak -&gt; Nha Trang (or something else on the coast) -&gt; meander down to HCMC

(2)  PP -&gt; EVP -&gt; Siem Reap -&gt; down to the south coast (Koh Ta Kiev, Kampot, Kep, etc) -&gt; meander to Meking Delta and then HCMC

  
So we're trying to choose between the mid-south west coast of Vietnam versus the Cambodian coast. 

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

On 16 October, we took a flight from Warsaw (Poland) to Miami (FL), and the checked-in baggage did not arrive. On 19 October, we are going on a one-week cruise from Miami, so we have three days to receive our luggage before we leave Miami. 

- No worries, I said. They will manage to deliver it to the hotel in 3 days. 

I WAS WRONG. 

We have an AirTag in the suitcase and it is still in Warsaw and we will not receive it before boarding the ship. 

All our stuff is in the suitcase and now we have to **buy a lot of stuff** (we are travelling with two little kids). This includes the necessary items, such as underwear, PJs, etc. I am not going to buy another portable speaker which I left in the suitcase - will manage to survive without it :) Just talking about necessary items here. 

To buy all this stuff I will incur additional expenses - such as Uber drive to the mall, etc. 

Since the lost baggage is not my fault - I would like to reimburse all the costs related to this situation from the airline. **Have you ever tried to do it?** Airline company - **LOT (Polish Airlines)**. I can find online that: The Montreal Convention determines liability limits for most international flights and are currently around $1,700 per passenger. But how does this work in practice?

Please share your experience.

We've done a month long UK road trip camping every night (incl. walking the West Highland Way in Scotland) &amp; walked 800km across Spain since July. Now we're in Japan &amp; due to travel to South Korea &amp; onwards but this type of travelling (sightseeing &amp; inevitably contributing to mass tourism) doesn't feel very fulfilling. We've still enjoyed lots of Japan as it's always been on our bucket list but we way preferred the physical challenges of the road trip, camping &amp; long-distance walking. It also greatly benefited our health after wasting away at work for years.  

We spent years saving up the money to take this career break &amp; it involved major life changes but now we're both a little lost on how to spend the rest of our time off work (likely to be until July 2025, savings-dependent). 
 
Originally planned to backpack (in the travel sense, not hiking / camping sense) through some of SEA, Sri Lanka, the Stans &amp; China. Possibly even visiting Australia at some point. But now we are craving other physical challenges that are more fulfilling and sustainable than the typical sightseeing.  

We love hiking, camping &amp; my partner loves bike packing. I haven't tried bike packing yet. I'm scared of other traffic. We have all the gear for the above, apart from me not having paniers (bikes, tent &amp; sleep systems back in Ireland, sadly).

We don‚Äôt have any kids so would prefer to stick to places that are more geared towards couples only rather than family friendly places. 

I‚Äôve been to Fiji once before and stayed at Plantation Island for a music festival when I was younger (conscious that it‚Äôs aimed at families when not hired out so haven‚Äôt included it in our plans) but it‚Äôll be my partners first time. I really loved how friendly and laid back the people were and have been wanting to come back for a long time.

I‚Äôd be super grateful if anyone has thoughts on this itinerary in May:
Day 1: Arrive in Nadi from Melbourne &amp; stay at the Hilton in Port Denarau (perhaps stay an extra night and take a day trip to Malamala Beach Club)
Day 2: Fly to Suva &amp; transfer to Toberua Island for 7 nights. Looks like there‚Äôs a few activities they offer like a picnic on a sand bar, a trip to a local village, a trip to a bird sanctuary island and a trip to mangrove forests which I‚Äôm very keen to do. 
Day 9: Fly back to Nadi &amp; stay at the Sofitel in Port Denarau for a night 
Day 10: Transfer to Matamanoa Island &amp; stay for 5 nights. Perhaps visit Monuriki Island &amp; Cloud 9.
Day 14: Transfer back to Nadi and fly to Melbourne

A couple questions I had were:
- I‚Äôm wondering whether spending that amount of time on the islands makes sense, or would people recommend a shorter time? I want to spend it mostly relaxing, snorkelling etc but don‚Äôt want to go stir crazy or end up getting too bored of the food options. I‚Äôm not overly fussed if there‚Äôs some repetition - I get that part of being on a remote island is needing to ship ingredients in.
- Is it worth keeping the nights in Port Denarau? I‚Äôve heard to generally avoid it and head out to the islands, but don‚Äôt want to risk missing transfers from one side of the country to the other. Conversely, is it worth doing some more exploring on the main land? I‚Äôve seen some trips to waterfalls and the like, is that worth doing at the expense of time on the islands?
- What‚Äôs the visibility of the night sky like in the islands? I see there‚Äôs Kadavu Island that seems to be in a dark sky reserve and Nanuku resort that has a stargazing experience, but I wonder whether that‚Äôll be taking up too much time to add in another transfer. Nanuku seems more family oriented than Toberua &amp; Matamanoa and from what I‚Äôve read Kadavu is perhaps more difficult to get to. Would it be worth including for a better experience or is it not too different to what we‚Äôd see anyway?
- Are there any other nature experiences near where we‚Äôre going that would be worth adding into the itinerary?",1,2024-11-15 21:47:22,Excellent_Stress_656,1.0

Myself and 2 other friends will be visiting Barcelona and we'll have 2 full days to explore the city in the first week of December, with the intention of taking photos (we're amateur photographers), drinking some (local?) beers, and eating some local cuisine, on a budget (or where your average salary man would go out to). We've luckily secured fairly cheap plane tickets and accommodation already (100euro flights and stay, per person if anyone is interested, from eastern Europe to Barcelona).


We have 2 goals, visit Sagrada Familia and take photos form the outside, and explore the Gothic Quarter since we're staying right next to it, and again, take photos. Ideally we can add in some other things from your tips in between. Questions for you fine folks, and hopefully locals: 

- Are there are any bistros/taverns/bars where you can eat and drink something local at a non-tourist price or budget you can recommend?

- Are there more obscure areas of the city that have interesting photographic subjects that are not in the top X you can already find with a google search, especially with regards to the more bleak weather we're expecting for December?

- Any thrift shops you can recommend? As photo hobbyists and grown-up nerds we have interests in photo gear and anything 70's/80's/90's clothes/games/etc.


If there's anything else you'd like to mention please go ahead. Note that I've already read a few short posts regarding Barcelona travel in 2 days, and have the **Spain off the tourist trail** post on hand for reference. Thank you!",4,2024-11-15 17:59:58,tachyonn,0.6

We like to have a little drink but are not big partyers at all. Prefer chill vibes. Not too fussed about all inclusive.

We want to check out Mayan ruins and cenotes.  Where would the best place be to base ourselves from for these kind of tours? 

While in Cancun I want to spend a day at Isla Mujeres, I'd even consider staying there over Cancun if it's well recommended?

How long would you suggest staying at each place? What order should we stay in each place? I'm thinking catch bus as soon as we arrive to Playa Del Carmen (3 nights), bus to Merida (3 nights), bus to Cancun (2 nights).  

Is there somewhere we should stay instead of one of these places?  We aren't planning to hire a car so would be travelling by ADO bus everywhere. Is the Maya Train up and running now and reliable?

So, I got excited about cheap fares and booked a trip to SEA over CNY. Google tells me Malaysia will be pretty quiet over those dates, but it seems Penang/Georgetown has some street festival type things we could possibly check out so I framed my itinerary around being in Penang over CNY. Regardless, we are ok just hanging out in a hotel and doing what we can. It's also possible that we could be in Langkawi over the holiday, so I'm hoping for a stronger opinion on where would be best to spend the holiday.

Had to consider the weather too. Would've liked to do the Perhentian Islands over Langkawi. 

Additionally, heard that traffic to Cameron Highlands before a holiday will be bonkers.... We are ok with eliminating Cameron Highlands all together and then using those days for either; Malacca (before KL) more days in KL, Ipoh, or open to wherever else you might suggest. 

My partner and I are pretty chill travellers. We just like hanging out in other places. We like cities and good food. Smaller places are cool too. We love nature, but not to the extreme. We like snorkeling, waterfalls, hiking and pretty views. Would love to do Borneo someday, but it seemed a bit more involved than we want for this trip, I think.

The ask: My family wants to visit Europe next summer from the US. We plan to spend about 4 days in London and want to spend about 3 days in a different city. The problem is that we cannot agree on the second stop. We all vacation a little differently but I'm sure we can decide on a place that has something we would all enjoy. Below is a bit of info on the vacation and family members...

What we're looking for: a city that is relatively easy to get to from London by train or plane (I know it's fairly easy to fly anywhere from London but we're thinking &lt;2 hrs by plane); has ""things to do""; is walkable or has reliable public transport (we don't want to rent a car); isn't insanely crowded (think NYC/SF); and won't break the bank (we aren't on a shoestring budget but we aren't millionaires either)

My husband and I are mid-30s DINKs who enjoy just kind of rambling when we travel. We usually find a couple of attractions we want to do and then plan other things around good food. We'll pick a restaurant we're interested in and then explore the area on foot and check out bars, cafes, shops, and sights. We enjoy moderate hikes or nature trails but also like exploring cities and just seeing the sights. We've traveled around the US but never to Europe.

My parents are active early 60ish year olds. My mom is just along for the ride but is not the most outdoorsy. She's fine walking if there's a destination. She has also given no input on this trip as she trusts we will not lead her astray. My dad wants ""tHiNgS tO dO."" Every city I've suggested, aside from Paris, has been met with ""But what is there TO DO?"" He's a big history and WWII buff so something in that vein would appeal to him. They also enjoy good restaurants but aren't as adventurous as the rest of the family.

My sister is a single, mid-twentysomething. She is a little more open to rambling through a city but won't tolerate it for as long as my husband I will. She's also a history fan but not to the extent my father is. She lives near a beach so she doesn't want to fly across an ocean for more beach. She studied abroad in London one summer and spent some time in Krakow (loved) and one day in Paris (hated). She doesn't want to go somewhere insanely crowded.

Suggestions made already:

* Paris - My sister vetoed it because ""no one goes to Paris and ever wants to go back. It's too crowded and dirty."" I disagree a little but didn't argue too much. This was my top choice because of how easy it is to get to from London and it has attractions.
* Barcelona - My sister is pushing for this one or southern France.
* Amsterdam - My sister doesn't want to go somewhere ""where the rest of Europe is""... whatever that means. Dad also vetoed it because it doesn't appeal to him.

I've been doing some research and have some ideas (Barcelona, Copenhagen, Edinburgh, Marseille, or Dublin/Galway \[not sold on Dublin\]). Any advice for someone stuck in this dilemma? Thank you in advance!

TL;DR: Help me plan a 3-day stop in Europe that's near-ish to London for a group of 5 who all vacation differently. ",7,2024-11-15 12:58:15,R1R1_88,1.0
1gs3nvf,Quebec City Christmas Market Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gs3nvf/quebec_city_christmas_market_questions/,0,"Hey All!

I'm strongly considering traveling to Quebec City next year for the annual Christmas Market they hold in November/December. I had a few questions for anyone who has traveled there (or similar areas in Canada):

* Any recommended times to go? (November vs December)

* We're planning on learning some basic French, but is speaking English seen as rude? 

* What are the best areas to stay in the city if we have no car?

* Do they have ride share services like Uber?

* Is paying with a card recommended, or should we look into withdrawing Canadian Dollars?

* Anything else you recommend/don't recommend?

I appreciate everyone's time. This would be the first time we're traveling to a non-English speaking city, so we don't want to mess it up or offend anyone. We're going to do our best to be able to respect their language, but I know I will be far from fluent haha.",18,2024-11-15 12:52:29,ScottClamBirdBoi,0.45

Hello! 26F solo traveller here. Nice to meet you.

Ohh I'm so exited for my first trip outside the EU! My trip starts in Oceania this December up to the end of May 2025. I do suffer from nocturnal epilepsy and have to bring 6 months worth of medicine with me. After much discussion with my insurance, I've got an extra month to travel. Making it 7 in total. Why not take a trip to a SE Asian country? So I thought. But after 6 months in high season NZ/AUS... Might be a little bit tight on budget...

For context, I'm a beginner backpacker and have no problem of setting up a tent outdoors to spend the night. Not afraid what might happen or anything. Ofc I'll take precautions to stay safe :) But a concrete plan? hmm... The plan is having no plan and travel around. But for some points of interest:

I'm a chef as well!! So I love to learn about food and/or taking classes or being invited by families and share dinner for example. Not a (big) city person, love nature too and I'm a adrenaline junkie, sort of. I don't like mass tourism and love to be 'off track'. What about volunteering?? Yes please.

Yes, I'm blond, greyish eyes and around 170cm if that makes any difference.

We're planning for 10 days in May 2025, and hoping to visit the Algarve, Lisbon, and Porto. We will only be taking carry-on luggage. We looked at renting a car for the Algarve, however neither of us drive manual so it would get pricy. With this in mind, we are hoping to mix use of the regional train line, and Uber/Bolt to navigate as best as we can around the region. Lisbon and Porto both seem to be very 'walking friendly' cities, but we are familiarizing ourselves with the public transit systems there as well. We are definitely more ""small city"" kind of people which is why we're only spending one full day in Lisbon, so we could have more time in Porto. Just want to make sure we're not overlooking any glaring issues in our planning. 

  
Day 1 - overnight flight that lands in Faro at 10:40am, take regional train at 12:25 to Lagos, check into an Airbnb, explore Lagos.

Day 2 - take regional train and then an Uber/Bolt to get to Seven Hanging Valleys trail, do hike, spend the day at the beaches around the trail, and possible stop in Carvoerio on our way back to Lagos also via Uber/Bolt and the regional train. We are also considering a boat/kayak tour to the Bengail Caves this day instead of spending time at the beaches in the area.

Day 3 - full day in Lagos to explore the town and beaches within walking distance.

Day 4 - take bus from Lagos to Lisbon mid-day, check into an Airbnb, explore Lisbon. 

Day 5 - full day in Lisbon to explore the town. 

Day 6 - take train to Porto mid-day, check into an Airbnb, explore Porto.

Day 7 - this day will be my fianc√©'s 30th birthday, so we are planning to do a day tour to the Douro Valley for a wine tasting.

Day 8 - full day in Porto to explore.

Day 9 - full day in Porto to explore. We are also considering a day trip to the Peneda-Ger√™s National Park for a guided hike that we found on Airbnb experiences. 

Day 10 - fly out of Porto at 1:30pm. 

  
We'd love any recommendations for must see/must eat places in the Algarve, Lisbon, and Porto, along with any other tips or guidance. TIA! :)",4,2024-11-15 08:48:44,krm2797,1.0

My soon-to-be wife and I are planning to fly over to Edinburgh for our honeymoon next month and explore most parts of the country (excluding the east side): Edinburgh, Glasgow, Fort William Skye Island and Inverness on a clock-wise road trip.

I think I've got most of details down but would really appreciate other people's opinions to spot any bad planning or misjudgement on my part. Here's what I've been planning:

1. **Edinburgh** (starting the day after we land) (spending 2 days. 3 nights in total)
   1. On the day we land, we arrive around noon so not much can be done
   2. Explore the city in the following two days
   3. On the 3rd day, take the train to visit Stirling Castle
   4. Could possibly pass through Doune Castle afterwards but not sure if there's good public transportation or if there's enough time due to \~7h of daylight (is it worth visiting after the sun has set?)
   5. Take the train to Glasgow
2. **Glasgow** (1 night, 1 day)
3. **Fort William** (likely 2 days, 2 nights due to the amount of daylight vs the amount of sights to see)
   1. Rent a car when leaving Glasgow (looking at Sixt): probably a SUV with automatic gear box and not sure whether I can / should ask for winter tyres? Tbh I'm a bit concerned about driving since it's on the other side of the road and I'm not used to the potential winter conditions / icy roads
   2. Loch Lomond
   3. Wee White House
   4. The Meeting of Three Waters
   5. Three Sisters Viewpoint
   6. Signal Rock
   7. Glencoe
   8. Glencoe Lochan Trail
   9. Ben Nevis
   10. Also wanted to visit Glenfinnan (to see the Jacobite Express line) but not sure if I should fit it elsewhere / other day
4. **Skye Island** (2 nights, 2 days) (not sure of the best order to visit these spots in)
   1. Fairy Pools
   2. The Fairy Glen
   3. The Storr
   4. Lealt Falls
   5. Kilt Rock
   6. The Quiraing
   7. Stay in Portree
5. Inverness (2 nights, 2 days)
   1. Visit the Eilean Donan Castle on the way from Skye
   2. Loch Ness
   3. Urquhart Castle
   4. Stay in Inverness
6. Return to Edinburgh
   1. Do the trip through Cairngorms National Park
   2. Stay for the night and return next day

I'm mostly worried about:

* With only around 7 hours of daylight (from \~8:30 am to \~3:30 pm), will we have enough time to see everything listed?
* Is it too dangerous / difficult to drive at this time of the year?
* Are any of the places I've listed not recommended at this time of the year?

Would also appreciate some input on:

* What would you add to the list?
* What would you remove from the list?
* What activities would you recommend in Fort William, Portree, and Inverness for evenings when it‚Äôs dark?
* Which of the listed places could still be visited after daylight is gone?

I visited for a day and it was definitely worth it. I went to Bavaria already a few times, it's always great there. This town has some very beautiful buildings, which you're able to visit in one day, maybe two if you're interested and taking time to explore.

Consider visiting the magnificent Dom, the Residenz schloss (and garden), the old rathaus, Little Venice. Also there are a lot of old churches and a beautiful cloister. The town is packed with half-timbered houses. The people are very friendly and the city has some great restaurants and caf√©s.

The town is famous for its Rauschbeer (smoked beer) and you can also visit some of these breweries. As a Flemish Belgian, I really love this. Always great to explore ""new"" beers.

I travelled a lot in Europe. Visitef many towns, but I'll never forget this town. It's a great town and that's why I wanted to share this with you all here.

The city itself wasn't destroyed in WW2, thank God.

So if you're in Germany (an underrated country in Europe), and you're near the town. You should really visit. There aren't as many tourists as in Munich or Nuremberg. Bamberg is an unexplored gem.

I'm (25, from the Netherlands) planning a backpacking trip through Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia from early January to late February. I'm arriving in Buenos Aires on January 2 and flying out on February 24 (again from BA), and I want to make the most of our time without feeling too rushed. I have 52 days total to travel.

* **Route:**¬†I'm planning to focus on Northern Argentina, Northern Chile, and Bolivia. I‚Äôd like to skip Southern Patagonia but am considering a stop in Bariloche.
* **Budget:**¬†backpacking, aiming for budget accommodations (dorms or double rooms in hostels). Open to night buses to save time, and a few short flights if necessary to cover more ground efficiently.
* **Pace:**¬†Aiming for a balance between seeing a lot and having enough time in each place to enjoy it. Don‚Äôt mind an intense itinerary but prefer not to rush through everything.

# We are thinking about the following destinations:

**Argentina:**¬†Buenos Aires - Bariloche - Mendoza - Salta - Jujuy

**Chile:**¬†Puerto Montt - Santiago (+ Valpara√≠so) - Valle de Elqui - San Pedro de Atacama - Iquique or Arica

**Bolivia:**¬†La Paz - Copacabana (Isla del Sol/Titicaca Lake) - Santa Cruz - Sucre - Uyuni

If I'd manage all this, I have to make a circle to end up in BA on February 24. Here‚Äôs the rough outline:

**Buenos Aires - Bariloche - Puerto Montt - Santiago/Valparaiso - Valle de Elqui - San Pedro de Atacama - Iquique/Arica - Copacabana - La Paz - Santa Cruz (skip?) - Sucre - Uyuni - Jujuy - Salta - Mendoza - Buenos Aires**

# Our Questions

1. **Itinerary Improvements:**¬†Are there must-see spots or hidden gems I should add? Are there places I should skip or spend particular amount of time in? Is this a realistic itinerary, or will I never be able to see all these places? I've heard that Santa Cruz (Bolivia) might not be worth it, same goes for C√≥rdoba (Argentina, which I didn‚Äôt include). Is it worth heading all the way down to Bariloche/Puerto Montt? I figured that going to the deep south for Patagonia is too time-intensive and expensive, but would this alternative ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for it? I also feel like there's a lot of room in between destinations in Argentina. If people have good suggestions for in between stops to check out.
2. **Logistics:**¬†Tips on traveling between these areas, including reliable night buses, affordable flights, and managing border crossings?
3. **Itinerary Strategy:**¬†I‚Äôm having some difficulties creating a solid itinerary. Some say, ‚ÄúFly out and you‚Äôll figure it out,‚Äù but with my slightly limited time, I feel like that might backfire. Any advice?

So I am going to fly to Shenzhen for 6 days and I am looking for stuff to do. Generally, I am interested in technology, startups (used to work for a tech startup), and in general China (history, today's China, talking to average people). What would you propose how I should roughly spend my time?

My plan would be to spend 3-4 days in Shenzhen and 2-3 days in Hong Kong inbetween. In Shenzhen, my general plan is to stay in Futian, and after the stay in Hong Kong I would like to stay in Nanshan. In Futian, I want to see the skyscraper district and the Huaqiang electronics market. Later on in Nanshan, it would be very cool to visit the headquarters of companies like BYD, Huawei, and Tencent. Is there anything to see at these headquarters, like trying out their newest products? Furthermore, I'd like to experience a bit of the nightlife and basically just feel how people in the most modern city on earth spend their day (I hope it's not just work).

For Hong Kong, so far I have no plan, but from what I hear there is a lot to see in HK.

Do you have any solid advice what to do in Shenzhen (and Hong Kong)? For example if you think that I should instead spend just 1 day in Shenzhen and 5 days in HK, please feel free to be 100% honest. Also, this is my first time in China, so if you have a typically Chinese experience to recommend, that would be perfect.

By the way, I can speak and read very basic Chinese, in case that's important.

We're a group of friends (2 Australian couples), excited to see some beautiful scenery and tiny villages, and enjoy great food and wine, next year, early October.

We will have a car and will have already visited  Bordeaux and Saint Emilion. From Saint Emilion we will travel to the Basque region (French side first), before continuing on to San Sebastian, Bilbao etc. 

I would greatly appreciate recommendations on the best place to stay on the French side in the Basque region for 1 night. We intend to explore the area in the afternoon, evening and then a little the next day, before continuing on to San Sebastian. 

I was considering Ainhoa, but then I also saw a wonderful hotel with an amazing mountain backdrop just near Itxassou, as well as some recommendations for Sare and Espelette. 

We will most likely briefly visit at least two of them (if time permits), but where should we base ourselves, which would be the more interesting stop, and how/where would you prioritise, given that we will likely have to drop some towns from the itinerary due to time. 

Also, when traveling from Saint Emilion to the this part of the Basque region, would you suggest to take the A63 as Google suggests, or would it be more beautiful and/or interesting to go via the slightly longer A65, or another route completely?

1gq98a3,West Canada by RV,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gq98a3/west_canada_by_rv/,1,"Hi, I hope I can ask some advice here about traveling by RV in West Canada, more specifically the breakup of the itinerary in legs.

My family and I (5 in total) want to travel next summer from Vancouver, over Vancouver Island to Calgary. Flights are booked. 2 nights in Vancouver are booked. RV is booked. So now we are detailing the itinerary. We travel from Europe and have about 25 days in the area. Given the party size, it's a once in a lifetime trip before the kids will leave the nest.

We mostly like nature, hiking, some local culture, and some fun activity along the way. During transits, we like to stop left or right to do some sightseeing or visiting a point of interest.

Below, I give what I already have as a plan, but I would like to hear some **(experience based) opinions on the length of stays at different places**. More specifically, I currently am hesitating between having some 1-night stops with shorter distances in between (see line 10-11-12), or longer (2-3 night) stops with greater distances, but then not having the need to relocate each day. However, my feeling is that by traveling by RV, you want to keep moving, otherwise we could have just booked lodges or hotels and a car.

Some options in the row 10-13 are:

* 1 night whistler, 1 night kamloops, 2 nights wells gray
* 1 night whistler, 3 nights wells gray
* 2 night whistler, 2 nights wells gray
* 1 night whistler, 2 nights wells gray (with one additional night somewhere down the table)

Currently, the time for Jasper/Icefield Pkwy is fairly limited but we would like to take our time in Yoho/Glacier/Revelstoke parks as well, so we have to choose somewhere. Is this a bad idea?

Also, if there are strongly **recommended First Nation visitor centres/acitivities**, please let me know.

so my partner is going back to Cuba to visit her family this year, and has invited me to come visit with her. She thought this would be straight forward as she went with her ex a few times many years ago.

However the legalities of traveling to cuba have changed since then, and her ex was not a US citizen. 

From reading online it says that tourism is banned (by the US) and you must obtain 1 of 12 visa reasons for flying.

According to some redditors (now i dont want to just assume this is the case) but one of the reasons for visa travel to Cuba is 'helping the cuban people'.

They say as long as you do not give money to the cuban government (i.e. stay in hotels that are operated/owned by the communists) - you are fine. 

I read on a few other websites, that there are specific actions you must do when  going to Cuba to do this, and the best way is to book with a travel group which has an itenerary that ensures you do specific things that qualify you as 'helping the cuban people'.

These websites specifically say, you cannot go and just sun on the beach for a few days in Cuba  if you go on a visa that is to 'help the cuban people'. 

My GF is saying that technically i am helping the cuban people, because by flying there i am taking a suitcase full of essentials for her family (who are anti-communists). 

But im in a wierd spot - where i cannot get ahold of anyone at the state department to confirm this... and i kinda dont want to just go and do this off the back off a few reddit comments incase i get into some legal grey areas.

My girlfriend and I are going to be married in the beginning of August 2025. We are planning our honeymoon a couple of days after the wedding. 

We are unsure which location would suit us best and where august is a great season to visit.  

* We are big foodies and try to explore the local cuisine as much as possible.
* We want to combine nature, city tripping, beaches etc.. Just a nice mix of everything is what we often like.
* We would like the occasional swimming pool or luxury hotel during our trip, but it doesn't have to be for all nights. We rather splurge on some activities and food. 
* We would like to go for 2-3 weeks.
* We prefer to go outside of Europe.

  
Some idea's we already have:

* Indonesia (Affordable luxury, nature, beaches) 
* Tanzania Safari + Zanzibar (Unique experience with safari and beaches but budget concerns and how much of a food scene is there to discover?)
* Peru (No idea about budget,  concerned about not enough sun/too cold to enjoy some beach/swimming pool time, we love nature but are afraid that the heights and a trek to Machu Picchu might be outside of our physical limits. 

  
We don't have a fixed budget yet, we are thinking around 8000‚Ç¨, but less would be better of course. Are there any other good destinations that might fit our budget and interests or what do you think about the places we already thought about?

My girlfriend and I would love some feedback on our draft itinerary for our Spain + Portugal trip. We haven‚Äôt planned everything yet within each city, but we‚Äôd appreciate any suggestions or thoughts so far! We prioritize food/drinks, scenery, beaches, nightlife, and hiking. We‚Äôre fast-paced walkers and tend to cover a lot‚Äîlike doing Rome in 3 days with 40K steps each! We also enjoy architecture and may visit 1-2 museums, but they‚Äôre not our priority.

Here‚Äôs our current itinerary for our June trip:

Itinerary:
	1.	Barcelona: 3 days
‚Ä¢ Transport: Flight to Mallorca (1 hour)
	2.	Mallorca: 3 days
‚Ä¢ Transport: Direct flight to Porto (2-3 hours)
	3.	Porto: 3 days
‚Ä¢ Transport: Flight to Madeira (2 hours)
	4.	Madeira: 3 days
‚Ä¢ Transport: Flight to Lisbon (1.5 hours)
	5.	Lisbon: 4 days
‚Ä¢ Transport: Departure flight to NYC

Total: 16 days

We‚Äôre also debating swapping in San Sebasti√°n, Seville, or the Algarve but aren‚Äôt 100% sure yet. We decided to skip Madrid since we‚Äôre from a big city and wanted to avoid an entirely urban itinerary.

Thanks in advance for any input!",6,2024-11-11 22:34:36,chilling5259,1.0

I'm going to Malaysia and Borneo next year and was looking for some thoughts on my itinerary. 

Open to suggestions if you think it's worth visiting some other places not on the list, or any suggestions for things to do at the places I've written down.

Day 1 - Arrive in KL

Day 2 - Full day in KL

Day 3 - Flight to Sandakan + drive to Kinabatangan river to stay at homestay

Day 4 - Full day on the river

Day 5 - Half day on the river, then spend the night in Semporna

Day 6-9 - Staying on Mabul Island + diving in Sipadan

Day 10 - Go to Tawau (stay the night here to get early morning flight next day)

Day 11 - Fly to Mulu

Day 12, 13 - Explore Mulu caves

Day 14 - Go to Kuala Lumpur

Day 15 - Fly home



I've had a look at flights around Borneo, and it seems this is the best way to order the locations to reduce transfer times between connecting flights from/to Mulu.

  
Do you think this itinerary is unrealistic?

2 weeks and the main locations are KL, Kinabatangan river, Mabul and Mulu

1gotbyx,Removing part of trip itinerary - Valencia floods,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gotbyx/removing_part_of_trip_itinerary_valencia_floods/,1,"Back in late August I booked a set of flights from Washington DC (IAD) to Valencia (VLC) via Lisbon (LIS). The trip was setup to spend 5 days in Valencia and 4 days in Lisbon. I used¬†[Flighthub.com](http://flighthub.com/)¬†to book the flights on TAP airlines.

Valencia has recently undergone major flooding and violent protests by a community that has a right to be angry. I feel for their pain but do not want to visit there as they undergo this period of transition.

All I we want to do is keep the first and final legs of our flight. So IAD to LIS and LIS to IAD. While removing the Valencia segments. TAP has an alert on their website referring to Valencia being in a State of Catastrophe and that free change would be allowed prior to Nov 30. I called TAP and they will not deal with me as they consider Flighthub my travel agent.

Flighthub will not accept my call. Only will consult me on chat. I've chatted with them 2 times. One time for an hour where they claimed to have called TAP and were not authorized to make free change. A second time I decided to inquire about making the changes for the fee.

Again - I repeat I only want to keep my IAD/LIS flights exactly as-is and remove the LIS-VLC segments. I don't need any new flights or changes to flights. I only need to subtract the VLC portion of trip.

Flighthub states that the nature of the changes don't matter. It is a rebooking. And a rebooking at a higher fare class. So in addition to the fees I must pay flight differentials. Total with differentials is $621 per person.

Paying differentials seems absurd in this case. I know I cannot just leave the booking exactly as-is and skip the VLC flight because airlines always cancel all downstream portions of itinerary when customer skips flight.

But if I just leave this all unresolved until I get to the gate this Thursday will a TAP gate agent assist me in ways that the phone/chat customer service is unwilling to? Are they less confined by rules? Or will they just make me call Flighthub?

If anyone has any true inisights on this matter please share. However please don't a represent a ""guess"" as a fact. The stakes are too high for me to let maybes guide me.",12,2024-11-11 08:24:08,Nervous_Day_8374,1.0

Does this seem reasonable? Any advice on where to stay along Amalfi as a home base?

Planning a trip to the north of Spain for 4 days, and I'd like to see Asturias and Basque Country. Had a couple of questions I'd love if you guys could help me with!

1. I know 4 days is really tight, and will probably not let me appreciate the depth of the either region. But this is all the time I have off work, and would love to explore both. If I'm quick about it and don't mind missing a few things, can both at all be done in 4 days? What would be the best split of time: 2 days each, or 3 days in Basque - 1 in Asturias, or maybe it's impossible to do both and 4 Basque - 0 Asturias/ 4 Asturias - 1 Basque is the answer

2. Summer would be ideal for the trails in Asturias and the beaches in Basque. But would Nov be an absolute blowout in terms of weather? Especially concerned with the recent floods in Girona... 

3. I don't have a car, so would be relying on public transport completely. Could this be a problem in either place?

4. Any general recommendations for me on must-sees/ don't-bothers

Family of 4 for NZ trip. Kindly note that we are more into nature stuff, and have little interest in food/culture. 

  
Day 1:

9am Arrival AKL, pick -up rental

4pm Hobbiton

9pm: Hotel in Cambridge

Day 2:

9am: Kiwi House

11am: Spellboud Caves (should we do waitomo instead?)

2pm: Drive to Rotorua

7pm Polynesian Spa

Day 3:

9am: Waiotapu

Afternoon: EITHER Taupu Speed Boat Ride OR Te Puia?

Evening : Mithai Maori Village

Day 4: Drive back to AKL, 

12pm  flight to Queenstown. I guess the rest of the day is wasted. Drive to Te Anau

Day5: Milford Sound + Cruise

Day 6: Doubtful Sound

Day 7:

3 options: Franz Josef Glacier OR Mount Cook OR local thrill activities (rafting, biking etc)

Day 8: Fly back to AKL in the morning, take evening flight back to states



The questions I wanted to ask was:

1. Is Mithai worth it? Should we skip it, go back to AKL in the evening (i.e. save a day) and take a early morning flight to Queenstown on Day 4. We will land by 12pm and we can do local activities that day. Saves a day for skipping Maori village

2. Franz Josef Glacier OR Mount Cook OR local thrill activities ? I've already done Banff, Jasper, Iceland, all the US national parks, so this is something really worth driving ?

3. Any way to fit in whale watching in all of this? I didn't find anything near queensland, and the only other alternative is in Auckland at 1.30pm, which means a whole day has to be found somehow.

Looking for some advice regarding our Italy honeymoon the first part of May 2025.

We are set on spending the first part of our trip in Rome (4 days).

Initially, we were planning on traveling down to the Amalfi Coast and staying in Praiano. Although, I am now a bit hesitant (thanks to TikTok), saying the weather can be rainy/chilly, and many beach clubs aren't open at the beginning of May.

I began looking into alternatives for the second half of our trip, and saw some recommendations for Sicily. They are obviously much different, but overall we are looking for relaxation, warm(er) beaches, good food, and a good time.

In your opinion, what would you recommend? We plan on staying in our second location for 7 days. Should we continue with our original plans to stay in Praiano or should we switch our plans to stay Sicily?

If you recommend Sicily, what areas have you stayed in and loved?

I had an amazing time although planning activities in the area for those with mobility issues can be difficult and it is something to be considered when booking travel accommodation or making excursion plans. We stayed in Villefranche-Sur-Mer for a more quiet and relaxed home base and then took the train to Nice, Monaco, Menton, Eze, etc. Along the riviera there are many different options to do, so much so that I would even say that it is worth visiting year-round although some of the smaller towns do end up being nearly deserted outside of the summer tourist season. 

I found the passes provided by the tourist office of the region had the best deals and had many options from water sports/activities, boat tours, museum entrance fees, and shop discounts! They come in 24/48/72hr options and are activated from the first time of use. It‚Äôs a really helpful tool and worth the money, especially for the longer passes, and acts as an insurance policy for bad weather or change in plans due to the wide variety of offers and the flexibility of use. 

Unfortunately on my trip I had three 72 hour passes that were never activated and I am willing to sell at a discounted price for 55‚Ç¨ per pass and you can reach out to me here if interested.

1go1sbn,What am I missing about Rotterdam?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1go1sbn/what_am_i_missing_about_rotterdam/,1,"I moved to Rotterdam about 3 weeks ago and will be here for just under 6 months for an internship. Before this I lived in the beautiful medieval city of Leuven, Belgium and will be going back there for a bit to finish my degree (which is why I'm here for an internship). Before I moved here I had heard from a bunch of people about how cool Rotterdam is, about how they rebuilt it after the war with the specific plan to make it a city with novel and unique architecture and how it's filled with culture and hidden gems all over the place and a great nightlife scene. I visited briefly in April for a night and something about the city just felt a little off to me, like it seemed a little lifeless and empty, but granted it was a Monday night that I visited and the day after it seemed a little more alive so I gave it the benefit of the doubt.

Now that I've been here for a few weeks and explored a number of neighbourhoods, I still feel the same way. Worse than I originally thought, maybe. This doesn't feel like a European city at all and that goes beyond just all the new glass buildings. It has a good transit system thankfully but it's so car-centric with freeways going through the city and all these soulless business parks with Mcdonalds arches all over the place. The new buildings like the cube houses and the markthal are cool to look at but they're massive tourist traps filled with overpriced tourist shit. The wacky-looking skyscrapers in the city centre are cool but they're just apartment buildings or offices so the only utility it really gives you is having something cool to look at as you walk by and it's not like they have any real interesting history behind them. And all of those unique, experimental buildings are concentrated in the city centre, if you go outside of it there's really nothing cool to see it's all just soulless buildings in boring neighbourhoods where there's nothing to do.

And the nightlife - where is it exactly? The party street - Witte de Withstraat - is like a block long. Another nightlife district, oude haven, is just a few bars around a pier and it looks nice but there's not much to it. And in general it just doesn't feel like a very vibrant city. It has a nice shopping district but beyond that and the area around the cube houses there's not many people out walking around. It's all just cars going through. It's ""old town"" area (Delfshaven) is very pretty but there's really nothing to do there except walk around and take pictures. No real reason to go there more than once.

I'm just confused because I kept hearing great things about it. Here on r/travel I looked up posts about the city and people seem positive about it. One person called it the ""coolest looking city in Europe"". Another compared it to NEW YORK CITY in the way that you can go out at any time of the day or night and find anything you want to do. I had friends tell me that they loved Rotterdam because it looks so unique. I just don't see what I'm missing. Aside from the city centre, which looks interesting enough but doesn't have a whole lot to do, it looks so mediocre to me, with so many cars, giant parking lots, soulless business parks, generic bars, uninteresting neighbourhoods, sketchy people, and overall just a lack of culture. I live with 4 roommates and they all agree with me.

I want to see what other people see about this city. As it stands now I would even tell tourists to not come here as there's no point - go straight to the Hague or Gouda. I spent a lot of time in Brussels and I'd always hear about how sketchy, dirty, and overall bad of a city it is but I fucking love that city. It felt like I could do anything there with endless museums, squares, restaurants, and bars to try. I want to feel the same way about Rotterdam so it doesn't feel like I just wasted 6 months of a 2 year trip to europe living in a place I hate when I could have stayed in Belgium.

I've booked my flights to HMC and my return back home from Hanoi. So it's a South to North Vietnam trip.

Would love to get your feedback on this itinerary and any obvious issues that I am overlooking. I know at a quick glance, it looks a bit tight but if I give it a thought, 2 days in any place is more than enough for me to start feeling like wanting to move on to another location/destination (Your mileage may vary)

**Here's the itinerary :**

**Day 1 and 2** : Saigon.

**Day 3, 4, 5 :** Fly in to Da Nang on day 3 from Saigon. Primarily explore Hoi An and if that gets boring, venture out to Hue for a day.

**Day 6,7 :**  Take a bus to Phong Nha (either at the end of day 5 or on day 6 early morning). Don't do much on 6th as the day would mostly be spent on traveling. On day 7, explore paradise caves and dark caves.

**Day 8,9 :** Fly in to Hanoi on day 8 from Phong Na. Spend day 8 and 9 in Hanoi.

**Day 10,11** : Bus to Ninh Bin. Spend Day 10 and 11 in Ninh Bin.

**Day 12,13** Bus to Cat Ba/Ha Long Bay. Go for the overnight cruise.

**Day 13,14** Bus back to Hanoi. Chill in Hanoi and take the flight back home on Day 14.

While it may look a bit hectic on the surface, with 2 internal flights the trip does become a bit comfortable. Besides, I am spending atleast 2 days in a place which gives me enough time to explore the place if I don't try to fit too much in these 2 days and take it slow.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this itinerary which is close to getting finalized.",2,2024-11-10 07:55:58,Due_Pen_3000,1.0

I‚Äôm planning a trip to Switzerland, and we‚Äôll be visiting Basel, Lucerne, and Zurich. I‚Äôve been researching places to visit, but most of what I‚Äôm finding are tours that include a guide, which are quite expensive. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible to explore these places independently‚Äîjust paying for entrances and experiences like cheese tastings, Basler Leckery Bakery, chocolate tastings, and similar activities.

Could you help me by providing suggestions for places to visit where we can go on our own and find the addresses or any other useful information? I‚Äôm willing to book and pay in advance for the activities if needed.

I‚Äôd really appreciate your help, as I‚Äôve mostly found guided tours so far.

We would be using standard precautions, just paying attention, not wearing flashy clothes, not being stupid. 



Also I saw a notice not to travel around lake Atitlan by car but take the boats. Is it safe to Uber/taxi from GC to Antigua and from Antigua to Panajachel though? I know when we went to CDMX it was advised to take Ubers and not taxis.

The view to the Lake was amazing. However the owners forgot to mention that there were very steep steps and even if you took the road it was very steep and dangerous. This property isn't appropriate for older people or people with mobility issues. At night there was not enough street lights on the steps or on the road therefore,  every nght we spent 8.00 Euros for a taxi ride back home. As the owner said they were not enough taxis by the Lake so the wait across the bus station could take 15 to 30 minutes. The owner of the unit didn't know how the washer machine worked. She said she never tried it.  She said the cycle can take up to two hours.
That long cycle ruined my clothes. Since it was a front loading washer I couldn't open the door to stop the cycle without water spilling all over the floor. I posted my review at Booking.com, platform which I rented 
thru and as off today my review wasn't posted. Don't they post bad reviews? I have requested a compensation and the owner said it was my fault for not checking the surroundings before I rented.

- a private, luxury room with amenities such as a private infinity pool, soaker tub and luxury shower. We want the room to have beautiful views. It is also important to us that we don‚Äôt run the risk of having loud neighbours right beside us who could potentially blast music on their balcony or disrupt our peaceful vibe, so we are hoping for a private/sheltered room. 

- great food and lots of selection (an all inclusive would be great, but we are also not opposed to venturing out for some meals as long as we don‚Äôt have to go far). 

- a safe, relaxed and slow paced environment. We have a tendency to get up at the crack of dawn to explore so we want something incredible that makes us want to stay put at our room/villa.

- We are envisioning spending the majority of our time lounging around our room and beautiful scenery surrounding the room. Our typical day would be getting up early to sip coffee while watching the sunrise from our room, reading/ lounging/swimming all day, going for a nice dinner every evening and repeat. 

We have done Dominican Republic all-inclusives before but we are looking for a more impressive room/villa to set our honeymoon apart and make it extra memorable.

We originally loved the idea of Jade Mountain Resort in St. Lucia but it seems out of our budget. We are now considering a Secrets Honeymoon package or trying Bali, Hawaii, or Santorini! But we are open to anything that fits this vibe! ",2,2024-11-09 10:38:03,okay_cupcake11,0.67

What are the best areas where we can spend most of our time at a resort with a large enough pool and amenities to keep everyone entertained but also be able to walk into a town, or take a boat to another island for some day trips to mix it up.  All inclusive resorts work for us in a way that our kids can eat and snack whenever they want, and also dont need to leave the resort to find entertainment.  The downside is it basically limits us to Punta Cana and Cancun, which aren't places advised to travel off of resorts (although we did a little in Cancun), and the food/drink situation is usually mediocre at best.  So we are starting to think about other areas which don't need to be all inclusive.",0,2024-11-08 08:41:58,ptg33,0.67

My husband (34M) and I (38F) are booked onto an 18 day Intrepid tour, starting in Hanoi and ending in Bangkok. We arrive in Hanoi around 8pm, and our tour group welcome meeting is at 6pm the next day, thus we have most of a day in Hanoi with no plans.

Vital info:  
Our tour **does** **not** include Ninh Binh, so we could squeeze in a visit on our first day.   
Our tour **does** include another full day in Hanoi after a trip out to Halong Bay, so we will see more of Hanoi a few days later.

Questions:

Is it worth spending a full day (day 1, in fact) on a day trip out to Ninh Binh?  
If not Ninh Binh, is there another trip/activity that's preferable?  
Is it feasible to do this day trip and be back in Hanoi for a 6pm meeting?

I‚Äôm going to Malaysia in December and started working on the itinerary but I have a feeling it might be too much maybe and I‚Äôm looking for someone who did a similar trip and could advise.

3 nights but 2 full days Kuala Lumpur (Batu Caves, Twin Towers, Little India, few markets and temples, maybe half a day trip to Selangor) would the Selangor be too much? Should we just focus on the city?

3 nights in Singapore (going by bus) here we don‚Äôt have anything specific planned, just strolling around, maybe renting some bikes to ride around the city, we‚Äôll be there for NYE so will go and see the festivities). Happy to take any recommendations.

2 nights Langkawi (flying from Singapore) the plan is to see the Pantai Cenang and the north of the Island, if we have enough time we would do the cable car and the Mangroves. Initial plan was to spend 4 nights in Langkawi but we found out about Koh Lipe which seems very much like our vibe and I think we will need a bit of quiet so decided to go there.

4 nights in Koh Lipe - taking the ferry from Langkawi and chilling there for few days, visiting near by islands. Since the ferry and immigration will take us a while we decided to give it more time plus it looks unreal. However I am a bit worried about going back, does anyone know if we will have to go through immigration in Malaysia on the way back again? Same day we will have a flight to Penang so planning on taking n early boat, does anyone you think they are reliable in therms of being on time etc?

2 nights in Penang Georgetown - here the focus is on the food but we want to visit the Blue Mansion and the Jetties and all possible food markets. We are thinking whether we should take a train or a plane back to KL from which is our flight back home. Flight seems shorter but since our flight is early morning we would probably just stay near the airport but if we take a train in takes us to the airport enter, right?

1 last night in KL but as mentioned the plan is to stay by the airport as we fly early in the morning.

What do you think, is it too much or totally doable?

We'd like to go somewhere with good food, whether it be caribbean, french, etc. but don't want the tourist fare you find in cruise ship heavy areas. On the cruise ship note - we hope to avoid crowds in general, so we don't want to stay in any big areas with lots of tourists. 

Neither of us are interested in night life beyond a beach bar we can relax and have some drinks at. 

Our dream accommodation would be on or near a secluded beach with good shore snorkeling, private pool would be a bonus but not necessary. Hotel, resort, airbnb/VRBO, we are open to anyting. Hoping to keep this around $5-6k for \~ 10 days (not including air fare), which seems feasible for Roatan but we haven't found any accommodations that stand out to us.

My name is relatively long. Let's say it's Taylortaytay Amandaqueen Swifties, so in my passport, they break it into 2 pages.

In my passport page 2 / Photo-page, name = Taylortaytay Amandaqueen (no lastname), then in page 4, it says Additional Name: Taylortaytay Amandaqueen Swifties (fullname)

In my India e-Visa application, we'd get emails when we save a page, and the system email always address me as the fullname. So I know my data entries are correct. When they asked us to upload PDF photo of our passport, I uploaded the 2 passport pages in 1 file.

**But when the e-visa is issued, the name = the first 2 words**. I suspect they only recognize the name in the photo-page (and ignores the next page where it adds my Lastname)

I'm concerned about 2 potential issues:

1. When I check-in for my flight/airline, the airline might take issue with the name difference in my visa VS in my passport/flight ticket
2. When I go through Indian immigration

Any idea if this name discrepancy is okay?

1gka51v,Indonesia Itinerary - Sanity Check,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gka51v/indonesia_itinerary_sanity_check/,1,"Hi All! We, a couple in our mid 30s, are doing a 20 day trip in Indonesia. It's last minute, end of November and early December. We have our international flights booked, but nothing else. We are flying in and out of Bali (flights were cheapest, we did look at multiple options, including multi-way). We have both been to Bali before, but a long time ago. We are keen to see and do as much as possible but maybe we are taking on too much?

Day 1 - 24hr journey  
  
Day 2 - Arrive 00:30 Denpasar  
  
Day 3 - uluwatu beach and recover from long journey  
  
Day 4 - uluwatu, **maybe do a road trip, or anything else that is not too tiring on one of these days?**  
  
Day 5 - uluwatu,   
  
Day 6 - Travel to Ijen - 4hr bus/1hr ferry/1.5hr taxi! **Maybe break this up by traveling up to near Gilimanuk on day 5? Hotel could arrange pick-up. I know Gilimanuk is not very nice but Banjuwedang looks good?**  
  
Day 7 - Climb Ijen with tour, midnight/1am start! Back at hotel around 8-9am to travel 1.5hrs to catch the 11:00 train to Probowangi, arrive 15:06, 1.5hr journey to Cemoro Lawang, arriving around 5pm! LONG day. We'll probs arrange a taxi to avoid waiting for a mini-bus to fill/avoid all the scams and hassle. I have a couple of quotes and I know it will cost more but we will have had a super long day.  
  
Day 8 - 3am wake up when we're already shattered. **Is this mental?** Sunrise viewpoint, caldera, sea of sands all self-guided. We want to avoid the jeeps and tours in general, **although it seems to make sense for Ijen due to logistics?** After Bromo we have three train options, 11:30am from Probolingo arrives Yog 20:30 on economy train. 15:10 from Probolingo but arrives Yog **22:30** which we want to avoid as that's a very late arrival. Or 14:55 **from Malang** which arrives Yog 20:30. So ideally we would want to get the Malang train as this allows us more time in Bromo but still arrives in Yog around 20:30. It's also an executive train so we could rest better on the train rather than the 11:30 economy from Probolingo. **But it seems all transport to Malang from Cemoro Lawang actually goes on the toll road via / close to Probolingo? Is there no way to get across to Malang from Cemoro Lawang with luggage? Google maps shows it can be done in 2hrs or so but I believe this is not true? Is that because of all the jeeps blocking the road, or the sea of sands/entrance fee? Or the road is not actually a road at all? Is it simply not possible? Anyone know or done this journey? If it is not possible, do you think we could make the 11:30 train from Probolingo if we pre-arranged our transport? How rushed would Bromo be without a tour? Sounds like it is about 3hrs of walking. Maybe do-able with a moped across the sea of sands? Could we get back to be ready to leave the hotel for 9.30am latest?  As out of season, maybe no need to book the train? Then if it all feels too rushed we could just go for the later Probolingo train or even the Malang train?**

Day 9 - arriving late the night before, staying somewhere central in Yog, lie in and do one of Prambanan or Borobudur. Probs do Prambanan as only 30min taxi from central Yog. **Maybe get a 1hr taxi from central hotel to a hotel near Borobudur, that same evening? Means don't need to be up so early the next day for Borobudur, and avoids having to go back to yog before going to the airport?**

Day 10 - Either a short or long taxi to Borobudur depending on where we stay, will likely miss the sunrise but also miss the hoards of people on tour. Taxi to airport for a 17:45 flight to Lombok. **Maybe we should build a rest-day in here and travel to Lombok the following day and take-off a night in Lombok.** I know it's a twat thing to say - wouldn't be if I said I wanted to swim and it's just a sport - but I'm quite keen to play a round of golf in Indonesia and there is a course near Borobudur. 

Day 10-14 - Lombok. Potter around on a Moped (I've read up on IDP/insurance/legalities etc). Waterfalls, beach, maybe golf, recover from all of Java basically. Roads seem good but everywhere is like 1.5hrs driving. **Where best to base ourselves, Senggigi? Or stay on ""secret"" gillis and just veg out? We won't have it in us to climb Rinjani, but could we do a walk with views without full camping trek? Any recommendations?** 

Day 15 - Fly back to Bali and then immediately fly to Labuan Bajo all in same day. Looked at ferry and flight options but can't rely on ferry with island time or rough seas. Flights seem less likely to get cancelled, still, will be a difficult day with maybe 1.5hr taxi to Lombok airport, 1hr flight to Bali, waiting around in airport, 1.5hr flight to LB, 20minute boat or taxi to hotel from LB. Also looked at 4D3N trips to Komodo from Lombok but can't trust this with weather/horror stories and too old to be stuck on a dodgy boat with gap year students and too poor to do it private and premium. 

Day 15-20 Flores. Stay in one place and do the 2D1N Komodo tour. Seems to be best as longer is too long for us trapped on dodgy boat and day trips will be too rushed considering it's like a 3hr journey from LB. I've read the advice about sorting that out there and checking out the boats etc.

Day 20 - fly to Bali to catch a 1am flight. **Is it too risky to take an internal flight on the same day as our international, the flight is not till 1am, so I'm thinking we just don't get the last flight out and then any cancellations we should still be able to get on a later flight? Or should we have one final night in Bali? Maybe stay Sanur?**

I know that travel will take a lot longer than what google maps shows, and even if we pre-book and overpay for private transport there will be lots of delays and maybe even cancellations, especially as it's rainy season. So is what we are attempting crazy? Or is it doable? On a side-note, we also looked at getting somewhere less travelled, like Sumba or Sulawesi or even Raja Ampat but all seemed too logistically difficult/or too expensive, or just not enough going on (?). Ideally we would like to see the big main events like Bromo and Borobudur but also have some relaxation somewhere less crowded / polluted than Bali, but also has good standard hotels/restaurants and things to do, hence why Lombok seemed like a decent bet.   
  
**Maybe we don't book our hotels/internal flights until like 2-3 days before along the way so we can remain flexible? We're out of season. Is that recommended? Prices don't seem to have moved for internal flights and there are lots of hotel options with availability everywhere I have checked. What about trains?** 

Sorry this turned into such an essay and inner monologue, and thank you so much for helping me. 

TLDR, are two night climbs in a row and multiple days of trains planes and automobiles completely mental? Is Bali, Java, Lombok, Flores too much for 20 days?

The busses all seem to run at random times (which I'm used to in the Balkans but not to this level, its basically guess work and when you ask they treat you very poorly) leaving me stuck in Elbasan and then a taxi driver insisting he give me a lift to a hostel for free and then demanding 500 Lek/5 euros.

Every other Balkan country (and every country on the planet) has its issues, but in two days here ive been scammed, conned and ripped off more than I have been in 12 months of previous travel all around the the Balkans... What's going on?

I try to learn and speak the language, I'm respectful of the culture, I'm aware of the history and I go out of my way to tip and leave positive reviews and just generally be a good guest in whatever country I'm in, and still I'm treated exceptionally poorly here.

If you look at google reviews you will see that almost every grocery store or bar etc has negative reviews from tourists who have been scammed.

Ive spent time in Kosovo and the attitude is not like this, I had a wonderful time there, why am I having such a bad one here? (I'm in Vlore on the south coast.)

If anyone has had a similar experience or can advise me at all on how to make my time here better id love to hear from you.

TLDR: I am very used to the Balkans and love it here, but am having a very bad time in Albania specifically and I'm not sure why.",121,2024-11-17 12:23:01,LumpyJunk69,0.88

I am based in Europe where notice periods are normally 3 months so it will take a while until I can start my trip (around March next year). I am lucky to have no debt, have saved enough to survive without income for 6 months. 

My plan will be traveling, working on my personal project on the go, and collecting life experiences and memories. I am terrified of the idea of looking for a job after coming back from the trip (I hate interviews), and fully aware that it might be hard to find something comparable to what I have now given the current economy, but I am still convinced that this is the right thing to do since I work in data analytics with a fair amount of work experience and companies need data analytics expertise nowadays to make sense of their data. 

Plus I feel like this is the last chance I can do something like this as my life will surely get complicated after my returns with marriage, children plan, taking care of aging parents, etc. I‚Äôve been dreaming of doing it since forever so I guess I just want to share and get the encouragement from the community üôåüèº.

1gtm43c,Indecisive on where to visit before attending conference in US,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gtm43c/indecisive_on_where_to_visit_before_attending/,5,"I'll be attending a work conference which would be held in a mountain resort at a ski town in Colorado in the third week of January. I already have the first two-weeks of January off as part of my annual leave so I thought why not head there earlier and do some traveling/vacation before the conference. I'd be coming from eastern Europe so I am already bracing myself for the jetlag and slight exhaustion from the long flights and layovers. 

So far, I know that I will be spending the third week in Breckenridge, CO where the conference will be held (would be my first time there as well). However, I am still indecidieve and have no idea where to go in the first and second weeks of January, and I do have to make a decision and book something soon as it's peak season. 

I was thinking since I will be bringing big coats, snow boots, ski clothes etc then why not stay one week in another mountain/ski area in CO or Utah and the other week in a warm destination (e.g. Florida or Caribbean resort/island). However, I do worry whether it's just too much moving around, flights, and layovers between these destinations for a three weeks trip, especially since I will be jetlagged and adjusting to the timezone in the first week.

Open to suggestions. I'm not sure if I should stay the whole three weeks in a cold place/region (easier to just pack one suitcase for winter clothes) or whether it would be worth it to spend a week in a warm place.  I have already been to NYC, Boston, Florida, Curacao, Mexico, Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, Panama..), so I would not mind  somewhere new.

If if helps swing it: travelling to Malaysia (or Sri Lanka, which we also looked at) would be around 40% cheaper than Cambodia (very expensive last minute), but perhaps this is re-balanced by cost of living? Not sure.

Anyone using travel insurance own a 2nd home? I am looking at something like Allianz Alltrips Premier. For myself and husband, about 10-15 domestic + 3-4 international trips annually for me and a slightly lower number for my husband. USA based.

We primarily want it for medical but the trip disruption coverages are also nice. 

We own a 2nd home that is 96 miles as the crow flies from our primary home. My husband had mild CO exposure once and this ended up with a $3000+ medical bill, because we went out of state to the nearest hospital rather than a few minutes more to one that was on this side of the state line. 

I think Allianz covers you when you‚Äôre 100 miles away from your primary home. Our 2nd home is 100 miles away by car but not as the crow flies. We spend a good amount of time at the second home - maybe up to 100 days a year - but never for longer than a week and usually 2-3 days at a time. 

In that case we could have avoided this if we went to a hospital 10-15 min further on our side of the state line. But it had been something even more emergent then obviously we‚Äôre going wherever is closest/best irrespective of price. But I wonder if travel insurance could also cover this kind of thing. 

Has anyone purchased travel insurance in this kind of scenario and is it worth either looking for a plan or getting a rider to cover this scenario? Or can comment on how they handle this kind of situation if you‚Äôve ever made a claim?

I am guy in my mid 20s, my girlfriend and I are traveling internationally soon (US ----&gt; Germany)

I am planning to propose to her on this trip (I'm so excited)

I have not flown anywhere in over a decade nor have I EVER flown internationally, it has always been domestic.

I am wondering about how easy it would be to get through security with the engagement ring and my girlfriend not notice while also making sure I am following all of the rules at play regarding what can go where and how through security.

I want to hide it from her however I don't want anything to look like I am hiding it from the TSA Agent.

What I think may be my saving grace is that we are both photographers and will be traveling with some camera gear/equipment. On top of the regular digital camera stuff, some of it is analog film which I know can't go through the standard x-ray as it will ruin it and I heard in cases like that, you can request that the bag be hand checked. That being said, I plan to keep the ring in that same bag somehow. (please correct me if I am wrong here or if there is a better way haha)

At what point do I make this request? And will they pull me aside more privately to do this or would I have to request this? I don't want them to blatantly pull out the ring box/ring and unintentionally make a ""spectacle"" of it for others to see. 

This proposal is going to be a COMPLETE surprise. Her friends and family have assured me she has completely ruled this trip out as a possibility of me doing it. I also know that she is planning a surprise trip within the trip to fly us to Ireland for a few days as well so multiple airports, one in the US and one in Frankfurt (? I think, I have no idea when she will spring the surprise on me, for all I know we might go right to Ireland and then Germany after). The only reason I found out about her surprise is because her friends felt my surprise was bigger and didn't want me to make any non-refundable arrangements for the proposal in Germany that would conflict with her surprise.

My research regarding traveling with camera gear was pretty straight forward. Essentially, you can. The only hold ups I have really heard about are some Security agents testing the equipment themselves to make sure it powers on and functions as intended (rightfully so). So I am not worried about that, just operating under as much discretion as possible with the ring as well as when/where/how to ask about the hand check for my rolls of film.

Having looked online, it seems that weather-wise, early April is better, but the problem is that we're only able to do it after July, and we really want to maximise the most out of that trip.

Along with this, there are places like Singapore, Malaysia, Dominican Republic, and St lucia as well as alternative to the many other countries BA have on offer so the plethora of choice makes it more difficult.

The problem is fitting in that time for a trip after July when it also hot and sunny as the weather in the UK is getting colder, but I feel like the list of countries provided is hot but in the rainy season.

London

Amsterdam

Brussels/Bruges

Paris

And then we are not sure if it is good to fly from paris to portugal and do portgual for 10 days. I have never been but have heard great things. We would likely do Lisbon, Porto, Lagos or possibly Madeira.

Must-visits?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gsjs2p/lazy_2week_solo_itinerary_for_vietnam_mustvisits/,0,"After travelling a few times, I much prefer staying in a city for at least 3-5 days+, taking it slow and chilling, even if it means missing out places. I find I like keeping it relatively simple if I'm going solo, I'll plan a full day looking at sights etc but won't do everything. 

I will likely stay in Ho Chi Minh for at least 5 days as I have a friend there. 

I'll be there for around two weeks during December (in a month). Quickly just mucked up this itinerary looking at some online itineraries and ones my friends have shared.

- Land and 5-7 days in HCM (probably too long, maybe just 5)
- 2-3 Days Hoi An
- 3-4 days Hanoi (incl one day Ha Long Bay day trip)
- flight back to HCM for one or 2 days then back home.

Can probably add two or three days to this trip (haven't booked anything yet).

I generally like more urban culture in cities, just seeing the atmosphere and understanding the culture (partying is also good so I wouldn't mind doing a couple nights of that which I hear HCM is good for) - I plan for hikes or nature views sometimes but don't mind skipping if I'm too tired. 
Big on good, cheap food. On a solo trip I don't like doing tours unless I can do it with a bunch of people from a hostel etc. Happy to miss anything that's very touristy (go there take a picture and leave).

Our plan is to hit Germany and the Netherlands, with some flexibility there -- we're basically looking for the cheapest flights we can get for our situation. My fianc√© is only able to take 5 days PTO in a row, so we are limited to Friday night - Sunday morning trips at the most sadly. The flight that we initially found that we were almost set on would be Icelandair:

TO: MAY 2ND

ORD (7:30pm) &gt; KEF (6:45am+1) , KEF (7:20am) &gt; MUC (1:05pm)

FROM: MAY 11

AMS (2:10pm) &gt; KEF (3:25pm) , KEF (4:25pm) &gt; ORD (6:15pm)

We would spend \~1.5 days in Munich, \~2.5 days in Berlin, and \~3.5 days in Amsterdam (I know this isn't enough time to do any of these locations justice but we're American and we don't get much PTO). I'm not so concerned about the tight connections in KEF as I know it's a pretty compact and efficient airport, I'm more concerned that both flights from and to ORD are flagged as ""Often delayed by 30+ min"" on Google Flights. My biggest concern is that our flight from ORD to KEF gets delayed and we miss our connection to MUC, potentially cutting into our time there or causing us to have to shorten our time somewhere else. We looked into other flights, and we found another one through Turkish Airlines that seems to be a bit less risky:

TO: MAY 2ND

ORD (7:50pm) &gt; IST (2:40pm+1) , IST (3:50pm) &gt; BER (5:45pm)

FROM: MAY 10TH

AMS (11:10pm) &gt; IST (3:30am+1) , IST (6:30am) &gt; ORD (9:50am)

As you can see, since we would have to leave a day early with this option and since the flights are longer, we would have to cut Munich from our trip and just do Berlin and Amsterdam. We would have \~3 days in Berlin and \~3 days in Amsterdam. Since we already have such little time we can take off, it seems silly to use more of that on flying if we don't have to, but perhaps we would be in the same situation if our flight to KEF got delayed.

How does my schedule look?Is Hokkaido worth visiting or should I rather go somewhere else in Japan for the Summer? What are some places that I should definitely go, 100% can't miss spots?Should I just not go to Japan in the summer and find another place to visit?Is a budget of $5,000 enough (including flights), looking around I see 2.5-3k+flights for the price.

Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm planning a trip with my GF (M 29; F 28) to Thailand from November 28 to December 8, 2024, and would love your advice/comments on my itinerary, especially for the last two days.

Here‚Äôs the plan:
	‚Ä¢	Bangkok (Nov 28 - Dec 1): Visiting temples (Wat Pho, Grand Palace), a canal tour, Asiatique market, and a day trip to Ayutthaya by train with a bike tour.
	‚Ä¢	Chiang Mai (Dec 2 - Dec 5): Exploring temples (Wat Phra Singh, Wat Chedi Luang), Doi Suthep, a Thai cooking class, Warorot Market, and a traditional Khantoke dinner. Day trip to Chiang Rai (Dec 5) by bus, visiting the White and Blue Temples.

Now I need ideas for Dec 6 and 7 before my return to Bangkok early on Dec 8 (flight at noon). I‚Äôm considering these options but open to other suggestions:
	‚Ä¢	Pai: Overnight trip for nature and canyon views.
	‚Ä¢	Sukhothai: A visit to the historical park to see ancient ruins.
	‚Ä¢	Eco-resort near Chiang Mai: A relaxing stay with nature and spa options.

Extra notes: I‚Äôll fly between Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and the Chiang Rai day trip will be by bus.

2 Isle of Skye 
2 in Inverness 
1 in Edinburgh, before flying out the next day

We are mostly trying to keep it loose, will do some hiking/ sightseeing along our travels as weather allows. 

I would love if anyone has recommendations for food/ dinners in the above places :) 

I have heard we should make reservations as much as we can so I know I need to get on this asap. 

Currently we have a reservation at The Mustard Seed in Inverness and at The Witchery on our last night in Edinburgh.

Our plan is to start in CDMX and work our way down south, we need to fly back to LA for an onwards flight to our home country around 20 January 2025. 

  
Our plan is to experience several countries in the region, maximising our time in a few places as opposed to trying to see everything. 

  
We are both late twenties and mostly enjoy food, local culture, the beach, nature, wildlife, surfing, yoga and the odd drink/party. We are keen to try avoid built up touristy places such as Tulum/Cancun and will prioritise more memorable experiences as opposed to laying around on a beautiful beach everyday. 

The itinerary below still has some wriggle room and would love any feedback/suggestions/advice from people. Particularly regarding Mexico and skipping Belize/Northern Guatemala in favour of more time in Nicaragua/El Salvador. Thank you so much :)

  
**Mexico**

* 4 nights CDMX
* 2 nights Oaxaca City
* 4 nights Puerto Escondido 
* 4-5 nights San Cristobal De Las Casas/Chiapas area (excluding overnight bus from PE)

Take bus from San Cristobal to Lake Atitlan

**Guatemala** 

* 3 nights Lake Atitlan 
* 4 nights Antigua (including overnight Acatenango hike)

Take bus from Antigua to El Tunco

**El Salvador** 

* 3 nights El Tunco (surfing and chilling)

Fly from San Salvador to Managua to save time

**Nicaragua** 

* 3 nights Granada
* 3 nights Ometepe
* 3-4 nights in a chill beach town where you can surf ideally not SJDS e.g. Popoyo or Playa Maderas?

Take bus from SJDS to somewhere in Costa Rica?

**Costa Rica**

* 3 nights in La Fortuna or somewhere to experience Costa Rica highlights briefly e.g. nature/see some sloths

I've been trying to research through Google but I still can't figure out what's best for me. I'm sorry if this is a bit of a dumb inquiry, but I've never traveled before outside of occasional trips with my mother growing up, where she'd just drive us. I know nothing at all about the traveling experience, nor about security.

We're needing to go from Orlando to Connecticut, as cheap as possible. I'm looking at Amtrak and Flixbus currently. Amtrak prices are high at the time of posting this, but I've noticed they sometimes go down later in the day, so I'll try later. 

I considered trying to fly, but due to being both large and disabled (6ft and a bit overweight, have chronic pain that can be irritated by cramped conditions, as well as standing still for too long. I travel with a cane and use a cart in stores as an aid) my partner does not think I should try a plane, given the size of an airport and how bad the seats are. My partner is also concerned it'd take a long time to get through security, which would also be difficult for me to stand and wait through. The only plus is that it's relatively cheap and the quickest route. I did find one airline I thought might work, the new Breeze Airway as it's advertised as inexpensive comfort, but he still is concerned for me going that route.

I'm reading mixed things about Flixbus, some people say they're pretty cramped if you're tall, some seem to think it's fine. My worry is that the drives are estimated at at least 22 or so hours. 

Amtrak seems the most comfortable, but that it might be more expensive if I can't find cheaper tickets - and we're a bit broke due to some recent pet health issues and house maintenance.

We can't really put off the trip any more. I need to see someone who is terminal, it is likely the last time I'll see them. I've put it off due to the relationship being very complicated and strained, but I was told recently there's very little time left. I also was trying to figure out who could go with me for support. It's .. been a mess. That said, it's possible I'm maybe misunderstanding some of the stuff I'm reading, or just not thinking well given the circumstances.

I appreciate any help and advice anyone can give. I'm sorry again that this is maybe a bit dumb - it's been a difficult time and planning this has been a bit stressor that I could be overthinking. Thank you so much in advance!",13,2024-11-13 16:03:19,misspokenautumn,0.53

Because of my experience last year I‚Äôm debating buying a larger duffel bag and/or backpack. Some of the things I intend to bring are: \*7-9 days worth of underwear and socks (not all the hostels I‚Äôm staying at have laundry services) \*5-7 t shirts \*2-3 pairs of long pants \*a pair of shoes to wear when adventuring during the day and maybe a pair to go bar crawling in \*2-3 hoodies \*3 Flannels \*my jacket I will carry and maybe a warm one to wear over the flannels when I go to the pub \*gym shorts as pajamas \*toiletry bag (to include micro fiber towel and shower slippers)

The things I will and might bring in my back pack are: \*my camera with a lens or two \*scarf and a beanie \*maybe a laptop I have some work that has to get done in the middle of my trip

I‚Äôm not a super vain person but when I go out to drink I do try to be presentable so I would like to pack be able to adventure as well as go out.

Budget --&gt; ¬†backpacking, aiming for budget accommodations (dorms or double rooms in hostels). Open to night buses to save time, and a few short flights if necessary to cover more ground efficiently. Travelling with my girlfriend so I don't want to stay in dorm rooms all the time.

Argentina:¬†Buenos Aires - Bariloche - Mendoza - Salta - Jujuy - Cordoba(?)

Chile:¬†Puerto Montt - Santiago (+ Valpara√≠so) - Valle de Elqui - San Pedro de Atacama - Iquique or Arica

Bolivia\*\*:\*\*¬†La Paz - Copacabana (Isla del Sol/Titicaca Lake) - Santa Cruz - Sucre - Uyuni

We have another family trip planned in a couple of weeks but there has been an emergency for my child and he is currently hospitalized. When getting discharged, he will need to take medication daily (just an oral pill 1x a day) for his diagnosis but the doctors seem pretty positive about him being able to travel. 

  
My question would be - Is this considered a pre-existing condition if we need to go to the hospital while we're on this trip coming up?

(For context - we bought the 1 year travel insurance package and he did not have any medical history. We're not traveling right now and we're at home when we found out his diagnosis. Doctors say that we just need to maintain his condition with daily oral medications. I'm just thinking worse case scenario - IF we need to go to the hospital during our trip, and they would need follow up work for this problem, would this be considered a pre-existing condition?)

  
Please let me know if anyone is able to give me an answer! We got the Allianz All Trips Premier Plan!",6,2024-11-13 10:42:41,sejbayk,0.5

I really need some help planning what‚Äôs likely my first‚Äîand only‚Äîtrip to the US. Due to some extremely sudden life changes, I have to leave North America soon and don‚Äôt see a return in my future; so I want to make the most of these seven days in a place I may never see again.

Since I don‚Äôt know much (or almost nothing) about the US geographically and want to be safe as a solo female traveler, I‚Äôd be so grateful if anyone can help me refine my plans.

**Trip Details**:
- **Dates**: Nov 21 - Nov 27 (7 days, 6 nights)
- **Plan**: Flying into and out of New York City
- **Preferences**: I‚Äôll be traveling by bus between cities to save costs and focusing on the East Coast to keep it manageable.

**Tentative Itinerary**:
1. **Day 1**: Arrive in NYC early, Fifth Avenue, Grand Central Terminal, Broadway, Times Square
2. **Day 2**: City Hall, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty. If the weathee is good can stroll in Central Park
3. **Day 3**:  The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Cloisters?, St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral,  Empire State Building
4. **Day 4**: Travel to Washington, D.C. for museums and monuments, the White House(overnight stay probably)
5. **Day 5**: Finish D.C. sights (still haven't planned yet), return to NYC in the evening.
6. **Day 6**:  Soho, Chelsea Market, Little Island
7. **Day 7**: (I haven't thought about this part yet), then fly home.

I‚Äôd love to know if there‚Äôs anything I shouldn‚Äôt miss or if this seems too packed.... I actually also wish to take a look or do some shopping in an outlet, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. 

This may be my only chance to see these places, so any advice would mean the world to me.

TIA!

I've been feeling the travel bug lately and I'm ready to take my adventures to the next level.

I was born in Brazil, moved to Sweden, and have been fortunate enough to explore quite a few places in Europe, both Western and Eastern. But now, I'm yearning for something more, i have been feeling that Europe has been fairly explored, and would like to take advantage of still being young and having a flexible schedule to have more adventurous trips, without needing to be responsible for family and etc.

As I always wanted to visit Africa, I decided to take a trip to Morocco as a sort of ""warm-up"" for bigger adventures. Renting a car, we drove over 1,000 km, exploring the diverse landscapes and vibrant culture. It was incredible!

However, I've noticed a bit of a challenge when reseatching about Southern Africa: most travel information seems to focus on the most Instagrammable spots. As someone who's not really into social media, I'm looking for more authentic experiences.

So, I'm turning to you, the Reddit community! I'm thinking about Namibia, Tanzania, or Madagascar, but I'm open to any suggestions, nothing is set in stone. 

Where should I go for a truly unforgettable adventure? Any advice, tips, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

Basic info: 
- I will be 24 (M)
- I am planning on going in mid April until 2 of May.
- I am not someone who packs a lot of money, but it is also normal a problem, so it would be awesome to be budget friendly

Hey

I am travelling around Argentina solo for 5 weeks from Monday. I plan to do half in the south (hiking in Patagonia etc) and then go north to Iguaza falls / Salta etc 

I've only booked the first few days accommodation on Buenos Aires as wanting to see what I feel like doing next when I arrive.

Would people who have solo travelled there recommend going north or south first? I was a bit worried going south in the 2nd half of the trip (early to mid December) would be much harder to get last minute hikes and accommodation as it's high season. I'm thinking places in the north are bigger so although high season, easier to turn up and wing it?

Hey, I'm still hesitating about where to go for a week between December 19 and January 4; we haven't set the exact period yet. Currently, I live in Paris, so I'm unsure if I should stay here for New Year's Eve or not.

Should we do 1 or 2 cities for one week ?

I've seen posts mentioning that many countries are quieter from December 24 to 26. Does this mean that restaurants, caf√©s, attractions, and transport are closed during these days? Which cities are more lively during that time?

We also prefer sightseeing, so is it still enjoyable during this period without freezing or getting soaked? What kind of clothing should we bring to prepare for the cold weather?

Some cities I've seen mentioned a lot are Vienna, Budapest, Prague, and Munich. Would it be better to focus on one city for six days and choose a more active destination for December 24 to 26?

Just to note, we‚Äôre not into partying or going to bars, but we wouldn‚Äôt mind attending concerts if that‚Äôs an option. I‚Äôm not sure if that changes the choice of destination, but overall, we‚Äôre in our 20s and mainly want to visit attractions, try various foods, and go shopping.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post in!

  
I am a 25 year old hoping to embark on a 1 year working holiday journey in the next year or so (basically as soon as I have enough money saved up). I currently live in Halifax, Nova Scotia and want to experience living somewhere different for a year, make friends, explore and learn from other cultures and in general just have a lot of new experiences! That being said, I have boiled down working holiday options to two destinations: Australia or U.K (Scotland in particular). I would have liked to do a working holiday in some warmer and culturally rich countries of Europe (Portugal, Greece, maybe Southern France, Italy,) but I believe that the ability to find work on a working holiday in these places would be much more difficult. I have also though about Japan but it seems there are a lot of restrictions on where you can work. 

  
I wanted to ask for advice from anyone who has done a working holiday visa in either places, to see which one would be the least stressful and easiest to find accomodations and a job. My sense is that Australia would be the best option, however I am a bit off put by how isolated it is. I would really like to do a working holiday in Glasgow or Edinburugh since it has proxmity of course to other European countries, but I am worried it would be difficult to find year long work here in a entry level position. I have a B.A degree and experience in customer service, hospitality and some dishwasher/light kitchen prep work experience.

Any advice on what would be the best for my situation is appreciated, just really looking to explore outside of my hometown and live a different lifestyle for a bit!

5 months ago we had our flight cancelled heading home from Europe. Shortly after we returned I began to seek our compensation that was owed to us. Our flight clearly met criteria to receive compensation based on EU Air Passenger Rights. This was on a Level Airline flight and I started by submitting a ticket through them.

1st ticket-Told that flight was operated by Iberia and to contact them

2nd ticket- Iberia ignores this ticket, new ticket sent in

3rd ticket- Sorry about your luck

4th ticket- We will pay 600 euros- refused as three of us flew and I know we each receive 600 euros

5th ticket- Iberia agrees to pay. Requires all of our passport information and the two others on the booking to write a letter stating I can receive their payment. They also requested my bank account information to wire payment.

A few days later I receive a reply stating that 1800 euros will be sent within 1 week-1 month. After one month after the date on this email I reach out to Iberia stating that I had not been paid. The chat person reviews case and states to submit another case. I do this and wait a little. Flash forward to today, I reach out to their chat again. Person reviewing states that they can see on their end that I was sent the money.

I need to make sure I‚Äôm not killing myself trying to see it all or losing time traveling in between cities. My round trip flight from my home base is out of Copenhagen. Nothing is finalized yet except Copenhagen to Berlin. The rest is very open, I just have to make it back to Copenhagen on NYE so I catch my flight back home on January 1. 

December 22-23: Copenhagen 

December 23-26 : Berlin (day trip to Dresden?)

December 26-28: Cologne/Dusseldorf

December 28-31: Munich (day trip somewhere?)

December 31: back to Copenhagen 


Every time I look up a Germany itinerary, there‚Äôs always a city people recommend like Nuremburg, Dresden, Bamburg, Stuttgart, Potsdam, etc but I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôll all fit in my itinerary. The non negotiable for me is the Cologne Cathedral so i need to see that no matter what.

Would you do anything differently? Will I be very exhausted moving from city to city like that? Would you spend more/less time or maybe add day trips here and there? A lot of Germans told me to skip Neuschwanstein Castle because it‚Äôs too touristy and to go to Salzburg instead. Thoughts? I know I‚Äôll be there during the holidays so I‚Äôd imagine many things will close. I plan on using the DB train but my last day I‚Äôm finding it tricky to find a train back to Copenhagen. It looks like I have to end up in Hamburg somehow to make it back. Otherwise I will have to fly back to Copenhagen 

any input is appreciated ü´∂üèª ",11,2024-11-14 07:48:18,shockedpikachu123,0.33

1gqzk53,Planning tool for my weird brain,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gqzk53/planning_tool_for_my_weird_brain/,0,"I'm looking for a planning tool that works with my brain, and I'm struggling to find one. It seems like all the tools I've come across are focused on planning specific attractions and restaurant stops first then travel, then accommodations, with the entire trip only spanning a small number of locations. For me this doesn't work as I don't generally have specific things I want to do, just places I want to explore. I also don't get to travel often, so having a little sample of a bunch of places is more attractive. The travel to/from the region and between cities (4-7) matters more, then where I will sleep each night (potentially while en route to a new location), then once I know how much time I have in each place I will look for specific attractions to slot in while leaving lots of space to be flexible and just wander/experience the non tourist parts. I should also mention that I don't mind a larger than average number of travel/transition days when it is train travel. I come from a boring land locked, car-centric region and will enjoy the train journeys. Also I will be traveling solo, so flexibility is much easier.



You may not need to read the rest to provide a suggestion, but I wanted to provide lots of context.

Here's sort of the logic I've been using to plan so far, and I'm looking for a tool that will keep track of everything and help calculate total time needed for various items on the itinerary .

I earn time off hours at work based on number of hours worked, this will determine how long I can travel for (adding in weekends later). I select a region I would like to explore, based off posts I've seen online for my hobbies/interests, and any attractions I've heard of and found interesting in that region. (In this example Western Europe). I research what times of year are the best balance of cost, tourism traffic, and weather, usually the shoulder seasons (mid April to early June). Once I know the optimal periods to travel I calculate how many hours off I will have for a given period, this tells me how many consecutive working days I can travel in that period (say the standard 10 days or 2 weeks). I then account for weekends and any bank holidays that can give me an extra day and determine the total number of travel days. 15-17 in my example, 10 workdays, 4-6 weekend days, and a bank day on the Monday after the last weekend. Usually the exact start and end dates can slide forward or back by +/-3 days to add/remove a weekend while still maintaining my maximum days off work. This sliding range is then used to search for flights. Because I'm not tied to a specific list in of attractions in a specific order to see, my arrival and departure airports can be different, and can be any in the region. I use flight search tools to find the cheapest flights based on my sliding start and end dates, and all major airports in the region. 

Once a likely pair of flights are selected, I plot a route from arrival airport to departure airport via any cities that have attractions I've noted, allowing 2-4 days per city. I optimize the order of cities to reduce or remove backtracking, and drop/swap cities that are too far out of the way to allow efficient travel (say a city that requires more than 10 hours travel between it and the cities before and after it). For example I would drop Vienna and Rome if my other cities were Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. Instead I would add London or Luxembourg. Now that I know what cities I am visiting, I need to know how much time will be needed for traveling between cities, and if night trains are available. I prioritize taking short trips (&lt;4 hours) during the day and long ones (&gt;7 hours) during the night. Next knowing if trains normally run all day or only at certain times is important so I can block out travel time in my day so I know if I will have an extra morning in City 1, or an afternoon/evening in City 2.

With all of this figured out I can now see all the nights I wont be sleeping on a train, and what city I will be in. I then find accommodations for those nights (likely a hostel) and pencil them in. Finally the plan is taking shape and all thats left is filling all the gaps with attractions, activities, and food. These are all roughed in with flexibility to swap what day each one happens in a city, with the exception of a few that may require reservations or date specific tickets.

In the end I'm wanting a plan that looks something like this:

  
Day 0 - Depature

Arrive at ABC airport by 18:00PST

Flight KLM441 departs from Gate C32 at 19:40 Duration: 9h50m

Time Change to GMT+1

- Flight to Iceland would be a bit cheaper
- We've been to Finnland, but not to Iceland
- In Iceland there seem to be more possible activities
- Rovaniemi may be unbearable cold, we'd need to get polar proof clothes (not just normal ski gear)
- But the weather and therefore the chances to see northern lights is supposed to be better in Rovaniemi in february

1gqkzc2,Flying Toronto Pearson instead of Detroit for US destinations,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gqkzc2/flying_toronto_pearson_instead_of_detroit_for_us/,0,"Hello,

Metro-Detroiter here. My parents have booked our entire family (kids, grandkids, etc) a condo in Orlando over spring break- end of March 2025. No an ideal time to travel because of crowds, but 2 of my siblings work for school systems and requested it. 

Right now, flights from DTW to Orlando are hovering btw $600-700 a person (nonstop, roundtrip). For my family of 4, this is going to cost us around $2500 in flights alone. I noticed that we could fly from Toronto Pearson Airport to Orlando for $150 a person, or around $500 for our family. That flies our whole family  for less than 1 ticket from DTW. I'd plan on driving the 4 hours the day before and staying in a hotel that offers week-long parking (around $300- so still less than half of DTE price). I feel like this would reduce the rushing and stressing of traveling with 2 toddlers. 

Now for my questions...is it worth making the trip to Toronto? I've barely flown domestically, so flying internationally is terrifying. We can check in online the day before, so do we go straight to security? Is customs after that, or only at the destination? Is there any service like TSA pre-check that could improve our wait times? I've read some horror stories about long flight delays and cancellations...was this just a covid-era issue, or is Toronto still bad for that?

I'm an anxious person, especially in new environments. If anyone is to walk me step by step through your Toronto airport experience, I would be SO appreciative!",35,2024-11-13 13:17:32,50shadesofPuppies,0.5

so my partner is going back to Cuba to visit her family this year, and has invited me to come visit with her. She thought this would be straight forward as she went with her ex a few times many years ago.

However the legalities of traveling to cuba have changed since then, and her ex was not a US citizen.

From reading online it says that tourism is banned (by the US) and you must obtain 1 of 12 visa reasons for flying.

According to some redditors (now i dont want to just assume this is the case) but one of the reasons for visa travel to Cuba is 'helping the cuban people'.

They say as long as you do not give money to the cuban government (i.e. stay in hotels that are operated/owned by the communists) - you are fine.

I read on a few other websites, that there are specific actions you must do when going to Cuba to do this, and the best way is to book with a travel group which has an itenerary that ensures you do specific things that qualify you as 'helping the cuban people'.

These websites specifically say, you cannot go and just sun on the beach for a few days in Cuba if you go on a visa that is to 'help the cuban people'.

My GF is saying that technically i am helping the cuban people, because by flying there i am taking a suitcase full of essentials for her family (who are anti-communists).

But im in a wierd spot - where i cannot get ahold of anyone at the state department to confirm this... and i kinda dont want to just go and do this off the back off a few reddit comments incase i get into some legal grey areas.

1gotfth,Review for AirHelp - just in case it helps someone,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gotfth/review_for_airhelp_just_in_case_it_helps_someone/,0,"Hi! I just got my compensation from [airhelp.com](http://airhelp.com), and I promised myself that if it actually worked, I'd leave a good review on reddit. Honestly, 10/10. Was so easy - I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone.

As for what happened - I had a 3 legged journey from TLV to the US via london (on a US airline). The airline cancelled my second flight just as I was boarding my first flight. And when I got to the airport for my cancelled connecting flight, the airline was SO unhelpful and rude and it just felt impossible to navigate the situation. They ultimately rebooked the flight but there was still a delay and just navigating the situation was an absolute nightmare. I found airhelp and was like - why not see if I can get compensation (I wouldnt have even thought to look had the airline been helpful/friendly). I submitted my claim via airhelp in August and got my compensation ($438) by mid-November, just to give you an idea of the timeline. Was honestly so easy and I would have never pursued the airline myself b/c they were so rude and dismissive - the airline agent on the phone claimed that there would be zero compensation, no food or hotel vouchers, etc.

One tip for airhelp - stay on top of their customer service. and do so via the chat option on their website (they rarely answer emails). their customer service reps are very helpful on the chat, although you do need to push them a little (e.g., at first airhelp told me that they received my compensation from the airline but that my bank details weren't correct. it took some pushing with the customer service person to find out what exactly wasn't correct. and as soon as i found that out, i corrected it and the compensation was transferred immediately).

So, long story short, don't take no for an answer from stingy airlines.",12,2024-11-11 08:29:01,Bubbles123321,0.4

Everything was confirmed and i was sent a reservation code so i can check my reservation at the airline's website. Everything is ok until this point.

After one month i checked my reservation at the airline's website to see if everything is OK since the flight is approaching. I see that they have rerouted my direct flight with 2 (!) intermediate stops without me getting a notice (either from Azul or from Booking).  
I also see that the original flight IS STILL AVAILABLE at triple the price from both Azul and Booking websites, so there is no cancellation or something that justifies the itinerary change.

I contacted Booking but i got no helpful response (they told me that they are not liable for the changes and they are trying to fix this with the airline, but i don't think they will manage to do this on time).

I know that Booking is not liable for the airline change, but it seems that the airline tries to rip me off by changing my itinerary to sell it at a higher price, but i get no help from either Booking or Azul.

I‚Äôm planning a three-week trip to Spain from mid-December to early January. We‚Äôll spend 12 days in Barcelona (to visit family) and the rest of the time exploring Madrid, Seville, Granada, and C√≥rdoba.

As part of our trip, we‚Äôre considering a 2-night/3-day visit to a European city outside Spain to experience something different. We‚Äôre traveling as a family with a 2-year-old and are looking for cities:

1. Less than a 2-hour flight from Barcelona
2. With round-trip flights under $200 per person
3. Family-friendly, with activities or attractions that our toddler might enjoy
4. Offering a contrasting experience to Spain (e.g., architecture, culture, vibe)
5. Ideally with great food options

We initially thought of Paris, but we‚Äôre open to other cities such as Rome, Nice, Porto, Milan, Florence, or others. Since this is our first trip to Europe, every city I‚Äôve researched looks incredible, making it tough to decide!

Could you share your recommendations given our situation? Thanks in advance for your help!",4,2024-11-14 11:23:02,common_man_1985,0.25

Me and my wife are looking to go to Europe next year for the first 2 weeks of September, what would be a realistic budget taking the following into consideration:

 Flying out of Toronto (CAD$)

5 days Spain: (Madrid and Barcelona) Santiago Bernab√©u tour or game if any happening while we‚Äôre there and just sight seeing in both cities.

5 days france: (Paris) 2 days at Disney, and the rest just sightseeing around the city.

5 days Italy: (Rome and whatever else recommended) sightseeing and small tours.

We are not looking for anything fancy, but we do want our own hotel rooms.

Probably a carry-on each and a shared checked in bag (maybe 2?) we would like to pick our seats in the planes so we would have to take that cost into consideration.

Let me know what you guys think, thanks!

When flying in the past, I usually get to the airport with less than an hour before my flight (it's a small airport and I've never had issues with security) however I feel like that will be different flying to another country. My first flight would be to Seattle and then a layover followed by a direct flight to Mexico City. What kind of documents/security should I expect going in?

I will be traveling to Austria on the 27th of November, and staying there until the 6th of December. All I know at the moment is that we're landing in Vienna and staying there until the 30th, but we haven't planned anything ahead yet, so here are a bunch of questions we have:

* Since we have 3/4 days to spend in Vienna, how many of these should we spend in the city of Vienna, and how many day trips/surrounding should we do during those days?
* In the remaining days, is it logical to try to visit 2 other states (let's say, Tyrol and Salzburg), or rather spend the 5 remaining days in one area only and explore it with its surroundings, if so, what area would that be? Salzburg and Salzburgland? Innsbruck and its surroundings? Zell am see?

* She does not have a driver's license (she has lived in NYC all her life and never needed to drive)
* She does not have a valid non-driver state ID (she has no excuse for this one üòÇ)
   * She has a DMV appointment today to apply for one
* Her US passport expires in April 2025 (planning on expedited online renewal)
* We have domestic travel coming up in 4 days, international travel in 7 weeks

Since my wife's passport expires within 6 months of our international travel, our predicament is that we want to apply for her passport renewal as soon as possible in case there are delays. However, that means that her only valid form of ID becomes invalidated given that she does not have a valid form of state ID.

I realize that she will be given a temporary state ID after her DMV appointment, but from what I'm seeing online, it is not suitable for TSA ID requirements. I'm thinking that to be safe, we hold off on her passport renewal until we get back from our domestic travel so that her passport is valid.

However, I'm wondering if we could submit her passport renewal and still use her old passport for domestic travel? It seems that TSA accepts identification that has been expired for under 1 year, which I'm thinking applies to this case. I also know that we could technically not have either of these pieces of ID and have TSA verify her in other ways, but wanted to rule this out first.

I'll be calling TSA today to check, but if anyone has any experience or knowledge on this, any insight would be appreciated!",16,2024-11-12 06:57:14,bjjeong,0.4

I'm an Indian citizen currently working in the US on an H-1B visa, which has a total duration of 3 years and is valid until February 2025. I'm planning a two-week trip to Chile either at the end of this month or late December, and I've come across some information that has left me confused.

According to a document I found on the Chilean embassy's website, it states:

""Exento de visa de permanencia transitoria a nacionales de India portadores de una visa otorgada por EE.UU. (excepto la Visa C) con a lo menos 6 meses de vigencia o Green Card, a contar del 01.04.2019.""

(Google Translate: ""Exemption from temporary stay visa for Indian nationals holding a visa issued by the US (except Visa C) with at least 6 months of validity or a Green Card, as of 01.04.2019."")


From what I understand, it might mean that Indian Nationals with a US visa (excluding C-Type visas) don't need a Chilean tourist visa as long as their Visa has at least 6 months of validity. However, I am unsure if this ""6 months of validity"" applies from my date of entry into Chile or if it refers to the initial total validity of the Visa.

I have already emailed two different locations of the Chile Embassy in the US but haven't received a response yet.

Has anyone else with an Indian passport and a US H-1B Visa traveled to Chile recently? Did you need a separate tourist visa, or were you able to enter visa-free?

We have a trip coming up where we will be flying to several countries in Europe.

If it matters, we are coming from the USA.

* Is it possible to rent a car for something like this?
* Any recommendations for car rental companies?
* Is this not recommended given the current Ukraine, or other regional, situations?

Any, and all, help or tips provided will be greatly appreciated.

thanks!

I have received quite a few replies in a very short period.  To every single one of you, THANK YOU.  Our goal is to get to Istanbul, however, we are OK with changing our plans if we end up spending more time in other places and just don't make it all the way.

The 20+ hours of driving is not an issue, so far my record is driving from the USA to way past Mexico City - through Mexico City - several times, almost 40 hours, not in a single shot.  We want to see, and experience, the local cultures and scenery, so we rather not drive at night or fly.  We are both extremely easy going about foods and accommodations.

The reason for this post is that neither of us speaks any language other than English, and this gives me some anxiety.   My experience is the further you get from a touristy location, the more you will have to interact with people who don't speak English.

I know Booking.com has had scamming problems in the last couple of years and is probably best avoided, but so be it -- I've used it regardless and now have a problem different than the usual scam.

I got a text today saying my credit card has been declined somewhere, but dismissed it as spam. I have a reservation at a hotel tomorrow night, though, and just went into Booking and saw that my reservation had a red exclamation mark beside it. Clicking takes me to a warning that my card was declined when the hotel tried to take payment today and that I need to update my card or use an additional method of payment. It's all legitimate-looking, and the route to update my card on file with Booking looks the same as it ordinarily would if the card had expired, but there's nothing actually wrong with my card so I'm not sure what happened and am a bit leery about typing out another card's number or sending money via PayPal, just in case this is a convincing scam. Should I be concerned, or am I being overly paranoid?

My banking website doesn't tell me anything weird has happened with my card, but it may only display transactions that were actually successful.

1gr2hog,60+ Days Without Compensation from American Airlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gr2hog/60_days_without_compensation_from_american/,0,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm hoping for some guidance on a frustrating situation with American Airlines. Here‚Äôs the full background, including all the details:

	1.	The Flight and Issue: On December 20, 2023, I booked tickets for myself and my sister from Nice, France, to JFK, New York with a layover at London Heathrow. The first leg of our journey, from Nice to London, was operated by British Airways, while the connecting flight from London to New York was with American Airlines.

	2.	Denied Boarding: When we arrived at Heathrow, we were denied boarding on the American Airlines flight (AA0107) to New York without prior notice or explanation. After inquiring, we were rebooked on a later flight (AA141), which caused a delay and significant disruption to our plans.

	3.	Compensation Approval: I filed a compensation claim under EU Regulation 261/2004 because the journey originated in France (an EU country). On September 16, 2024, I received confirmation from American Airlines Customer Relations that they had approved compensation for us. They promised ‚Ç¨600 each for myself and my sister, totaling ‚Ç¨1,200, and stated that payment would be made within 45 days.

	4.	Prolonged Delays and Lack of Updates: Despite the assurance, the 45-day period has long since passed, and it‚Äôs now been over 60 days. I‚Äôve reached out multiple times to the Customer Relations team via email and also contacted their social media support on X (Twitter) for assistance. I have received acknowledgments, but no concrete updates or reasons for the delay.

	5.	Missed Follow-ups: American Airlines missed a scheduled follow-up call on November 2, 2024, and I have since sent more follow-up emails with no satisfactory response. I was told by the X support team yesterday that Customer Relations had received my latest message and would respond, but still, I received nothing.

	6.	Next Steps - Considering Small Claims: At this point, I‚Äôm considering filing a small claim to resolve the issue and obtain the compensation promised to me. However, I have a few questions before I proceed:
	‚Ä¢	Is filing a small claim the right choice here? Has anyone else gone through this, and if so, did it lead to a resolution?
	‚Ä¢	Which jurisdiction should I file in? The trip originated in France, where the EU regulations apply, but the issue occurred at London Heathrow, which is in the UK and now outside the EU. Should I file in France based on EU Regulation 261/2004, or should I consider filing in the UK since that‚Äôs where we were denied boarding?

Any advice or experiences with similar situations would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôve been more than patient with this process, but the lack of communication and delays have been incredibly frustrating, and I‚Äôm unsure about the best course of action moving forward.

Thank you in advance for any help or suggestions!",3,2024-11-14 05:13:31,Master_Mango702,0.14

1gou2sv,Best American Cities to Visit in 2 weeks?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gou2sv/best_american_cities_to_visit_in_2_weeks/,0,"Hi guys,

I'm a (soon to be) 24 year old male from London hoping to make the trip across the pond. I plan to go next summer, and would like to curate a nice plan in the meantime.

I'm looking for a mix of urban city and nature, but leaning more towards the former. NYC is a must, and also Minneapolis since I'd like to visit the mall and the Somali community there(since I am one). San Francisco is also a personal favourite, due to it's walkability. I'm tempted to visit a national park like Yosemite or Yellowstone. I'm happy to rent a car if necessary, but not sure how easy the process would be.

Based on my criteria, what cities/states fit the bill, and is 2 weeks lobg enough to explore these different areas? I'd be willing to up it to a month, but would like to understand what I'm working with. Should I limit the number of locations to really enjoy each place to its fullest? Many thanks!

I had to stop him in his rant to ask what happens to my bag if I have to leave it there. He told me to ask the gate agent.

I explained that I was advised not to leave the clean area. Without ID only a manager can check me through the TSA check point.

Here's my question: How can I contact United to ask them to change my name on my flight ticket to match my maiden name?

They were just telling me all the info/details of me and my flights. Which is it doesn‚Äôt seem like sus right?

There was a WhatsApp number on the listing saying I could contact the host direct so I dropped them a message. They took awhile to get back to be, by which my second booking request had expired. They asked if I wanted to book the place and pay now to secure the booking which I was okay to. I asked them if I needed to make another booking request, but they said they could send me a personalised booking link instead. The link they sent looked like a booking.com website!

I tried to make payment but it didn‚Äôt go through, my bank didn‚Äôt even notify me to authenticate the transaction. Weird though immediately after that the fake host messaged me and said she was notified by customer service that I have to authenticate it in my bank‚Äôs app which I though was strange how would they know I was at the payment stage? 

At this point I went to check the listing on booking.com but it was gone. I think the fake website wasn‚Äôt even a merchant site so they couldn‚Äôt actually charge my card thank goodness but after that the fake host asked if I wanted to pay via PayPal instead direct to them.

1gqlrg1,Totally Unprofessional Experience with Etihad Airways ,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gqlrg1/totally_unprofessional_experience_with_etihad/,0,"
I‚Äôm sharing my experience with Etihad Airways, hoping it helps others and raises awareness about how unprofessionally they handled our situation.

We had booked return tickets for 2 adults and 2 kids from Ahmedabad to Abu Dhabi, traveling from November 3 to November 11, through Etihad‚Äôs official website. All seemed fine until we arrived at Abu Dhabi airport for our return flight on November 11. At check-in, we were told that our tickets had been canceled.

The Shocking Part:

1. No Notification or Refund:
I never canceled or modified the tickets, nor did I receive any email or message from Etihad about the cancellation. Even worse, no refund had been issued to my credit card.


2. No On-Site Assistance:
We were at Etihad‚Äôs hub airport, yet no one was willing to assist. The airport staff told us to contact the call center, saying this was not their responsibility. Even Etihad‚Äôs ticketing office at the airport refused to help with the matter.



A Nightmare of Calls:

At 10:30 PM on November 11, I called the Etihad call center. They told me that the cancellation was a ‚Äúsystem error‚Äù and that I could get a refund. I explained that I didn‚Äôt want a refund because booking new tickets on such short notice was four times more expensive. I offered to fly from Abu Dhabi, Dubai, or Sharjah, but I needed a direct flight to Ahmedabad. The agent told me the relevant department would call back within 2 hours.

We waited at our friend‚Äôs place in Dubai, as there was no immediate resolution. Thankfully, we had friends there; otherwise, we‚Äôd have been stranded, forced to stay in a hotel at our expense.

At 12:30 AM on November 12, I called again. This time, I was told to keep my phone nearby, as they‚Äôd definitely call within 2 hours. But no one called.

By 9:30 AM on November 12, I called again, only to be told that these issues can take up to 24 hours. Meanwhile, ticket prices kept climbing. When I mentioned this, the agent suggested buying new tickets from Etihad and claiming a refund later. However, the prices were now 10 times higher, and there was no guarantee my claim would be approved. I couldn‚Äôt take that risk.

Where Is the Humanity?

On November 13 at 3 PM, I made yet another call. By then, we‚Äôd spent two days waiting for a resolution, staying at our friend‚Äôs place. I tried to reason with them‚Äîexplaining that this was not only inconvenient but also deeply unfair. What if we didn‚Äôt have financial means or friends to help? A family could be stranded at the airport with nowhere to go.

The call center agent sympathized but admitted they had no authority to resolve this. He even discouraged me from opening a formal case, saying it would take over 7 days for a response. I insisted they note in the system that I could no longer wait, as my kids had school, and I had to return to work.

At this point, it felt like Etihad was just ignoring us, hoping we‚Äôd give up and move on.

Forced to Book New Tickets:

Finally, on November 13 at 4 PM, with no callback or resolution from Etihad, I had no choice but to book new tickets through SpiceJet, paying three times the average fare. We flew back to Ahmedabad on the 7:25 PM flight.

The Aftermath:

I‚Äôll be following up with Etihad Airways about this, but the experience left us deeply frustrated. A few points stand out:

1. Zero Accountability: How can a ticket be canceled ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù without any notification or refund?


2. No Empathy: For two days, a family with children was left stranded with no support. Their staff seemed indifferent to our plight.


3. No Resolution Mechanism: Relying solely on a call center with no decision-making power shows a complete lack of preparation for such incidents.



This situation was both financially and emotionally draining for us. If I didn‚Äôt have the resources or support, I can‚Äôt imagine what we would have done.

To anyone considering flying with Etihad Airways, please be cautious. Their lack of professionalism and customer service during critical times is unacceptable. If anyone has experienced something similar, please share your advice or thoughts on how to hold them accountable.

I‚Äôm reaching out to Etihad one last time to resolve this fairly, but I wouldn‚Äôt wish this experience on anyone.

First time: I was doing immigration in Turkey. When my turn came, I couldn't find my passport. I left it in my suitcase which I sent to the plane. I had to go running to the airline to beg them to send my baggage back. I lost my first flight to Rome because of it.

Second time: I left my bag with my money and passport in the taxi cab. I called the taxi cab and he gave me my bag back half an hour later. I lost my second flight to Lisbon because of it.

I had to pay 700 euros buying last minute flights to my destinies. However, I feel depressed. I feel the most stupid person in the world. And this is so embarassing I can't even tell nobody. Just came here to get this off my chest. I arrived to Lisbon early and just stayed in my hotel room all day because I feel so sad. It's really embarassing. It's my first time travelling alone from Latin America. ",12,2024-11-17 11:36:39,DepFol32,0.17

I‚Äôm fantasizing about getting a diagram showing 8 horizontal stamps with a tick and the random sloppy stamps with a cross and giving that to immigration, along with my passport, or putting a post it note template in with a space for them to stamp.

1gremz1,How can I keep my toothbrush from getting gross on long trips?,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gremz1/how_can_i_keep_my_toothbrush_from_getting_gross/,0,"For all of my trips, I keep my electric toothbrush in a gallon freezer ziploc bag. I rinse it thoroughly and pack it away in the bag before I check out of each hotel, or if I‚Äôm staying at a hostel, I rinse it and pack it away after every single use. But it gets so gross in that ziploc bag after a week or two that I sometimes rinse out the bag too. I bring extra heads, but I have to change them out pretty often because the bag itself gets so gross so quickly. Is there a better way to manage this?

My electric toothbrush didn‚Äôt come with a case, that‚Äôs why I keep it in a ziploc bag, but even if I did have a case, I‚Äôm not convinced that it would do that much better of a job at preventing the toothbrush from becoming gross. Even the cases with holes don‚Äôt seem to help the toothbrush dry, and they also let the grossness of your toothbrush ooze out onto your luggage, right? And cases without holes are essentially rigid ziploc bags, right?

I‚Äôm especially concerned about my next trip; I‚Äôll be staying in hostels every day for a couple of months and changing cities every couple of days. For example, a good chunk of my trip will be spent checking out Christmas markets in different European cities. I already gave up on bringing my wall-charging electric toothbrush, since I would have no easy way of charging it. I opted for the Oral B Pro 100 with two AA batteries, but I still don‚Äôt know how I would keep it clean. It doesn‚Äôt come with a case btw. Should I get one?

It‚Äôs not ideal for the environment, sure, but my current plan is just to buy a roll of paper towels and dry off my toothbrush before putting it back in a case.

I am curious if anyone else has any ideas! Surely someone has figured this out by now, right?!?!",39,2024-11-14 14:39:07,dudeguy409,0.29

Maybe I just got the wrong flights or just a bad day, so I‚Äôm really hoping somebody tells me they don‚Äôt normally operate like this.  First flight was a little over an hour.  They start to board and we are boarding via air stairs.  They have two air stairs, front and back.  But they give no info or guidance.  It‚Äôs a damn free for all once they open the doors to walk out to board.  People getting on the front of the plane walking to their seats in the back and vice versa.  It was a complete cluster.  People trying to get by each other in the aisle with bags, no manners at all.  Just a shitshow.  Then, while on the 1 hour full flight, they try and give out food and drink and offering options.  Of course people need an explanation of what is being offered, so by the time they get to the back 1/4 of the plane, they are almost out of time.  They hand you your food and drink, store the carts and in less than 3-4 mins of handing you your meals, walk through telling you to close your trays, they are about to land.  Never came through to get trash.  So, whoever had to clean that flight had to be pissed. Saw many half full cups stuffed in the seat back as I got off (I didn‚Äôt get any food or drink, it was only an hour flight).  Second flight, same damn boarding process.  Two stairs, no direction, free for all.  I won‚Äôt talk about the FaceTime calls that happened as we were landing or the numerous seats that were reclined upon landing as they are just dumb people who don‚Äôt listen.  Both of these flights were international flights connecting through Athens.  I‚Äôm very versed with budget airlines, but this was on a whole new level.  Will avoid at all costs going forward.

Here‚Äôs the issue: if we want to cancel the original booking through Booking.com, they‚Äôre charging us an ‚Ç¨88 cancellation fee. Their reasoning is that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have enough time to find new guests.‚Äù But this doesn‚Äôt make sense to me‚Äîwe‚Äôve already paid for the day, so they haven‚Äôt lost any money. Why should they care if we show up or not? If anything, they save on cleaning and room service because the room won‚Äôt be used.

It feels unreasonable and almost criminal to charge a fee in this situation, especially since this is due to circumstances completely beyond our control. There‚Äôs an option on Booking.com to request a waiver of the fee, but I don‚Äôt have much hope that they‚Äôll approve it.

The part that really bothers me is that even if we don‚Äôt cancel and just don‚Äôt show up, Booking.com says the fee will still be charged to our credit card. How does the hotel even prove we didn‚Äôt show up?

The only leverage I can think of is threatening them with a one-star review if they go through with charging the fee. Another option is canceling my credit card to prevent the charge entirely, but that feels extreme.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Any advice on how to handle it would be much appreciated!

Eddit: to be clear, i don‚Äôt expect a refund. I already paid 90‚Ç¨ for the night. It‚Äôs already gone off my credit card. Booking.com is charging another 88‚Ç¨ for canceling or not showing up.

To make this clearer: imagine you book a ticket to a museum and pay ‚Ç¨20 upfront. If you don‚Äôt show up, the museum has already been paid‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt lose any money. But now imagine they deduct another ‚Ç¨20 from your credit card just because you didn‚Äôt show up. How does that make any sense?",11,2024-11-16 16:01:59,Ruser-94,0.1

We love discovering new places that we might not have heard of. 

Our starting point is Denmark and we have a 6-week holiday. We could move around, but we prefer to stay in one place for at least 1-2 weeks at a time, and not have too long travel days between relocations. We can fly to our destination, but prefer bus/train/rental cars once there. Here is a description of our ideal destination:

* A place that has calm, walkable streets. We want to be able to split up and explore solo without feeling unsafe. I (F33) also enjoy jogging by myself.
* Historical town(s) with museums and/or interesting architecture
* A place that is sunnier and warmer than Denmark (the bar is low, so 15\*C/59\*F and upwards is fine for us). 
* We are foodies and love good food. Ideally, authentic, local, nice cafes and restaurants. We love people-watching and can spend a full day at a cozy cafe.
* Budget: We'd rather spend more on food and activities and less on accommodation. I'd say our total budget is 100-150 USD/day.
* We love hiking, so taking a few days off our people-watching schedule to enjoy some good hikes is definitely a bonus.
* We are travelling off-season (for Europe, at least), so we want to avoid typical tourist areas, as they are usually pretty dead at this time of year.
* We'd love a new place! We've recently travelled extensively in Albania, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia and New Zealand. We've also been short trips to other countries, but are open for suggestions within those countries. We've already been to: Italy (Sicily, Rome, Naples, Milano), Spain (Barcelona), Greece (Corfu), Croatia (Dubrovnik and Split).

  
If you guys have any suggestions, we would love to hear them. In return, we'd be happy to offer tips on the places mentioned above! ",0,2024-11-17 18:05:20,Spoiledanchovies,0.5

However once I started dating my current partner, traveling with him has often left me with this unfulfilling feeling. I've traveled many places with him so this is not a one off experience. Side notes, I love to explore the hidden paths with breath taking sceneries as well as visiting historical sites with old architectures. Pretty much I just wanna see everything that is uniquely to that destination. My partner on the other hand, is a man with few words. He never seems excited for anything I planned and doesn't really initiate anything that he wants to do and I feel like I'm the only one doing all the planning, which I don't mind at all but I feel like he isn't enjoying the itineraries that I've created. Also, he loves comfort and often love to just stayed in at resorts and explore the food culture which there is nothing wrong with that. I do compromise and make sure to include the things he would like to do based on the little info he has communicated to me. However, when we get to do the things I wanna do, he always shows no interest and most of the time just tags along. On some other occasions, he would opt out or refuse to participate in extreme water sports or thrilling activities (bungee jumping or skydiving). I feel like he just not really down to explore anything new and really stuck in his way. AITA for thinking he's just a boring person with no interests in trying new things? Is there anything I can do to help make things more exciting for the both of us?

Notes: We're going on vacation in 2 days and going to 2 location in Vietnam (Dalat &amp; Phu Quoc). Dalat is relaxing and Phu Quoc is and island with many beaches as well as resorts. We're staying at resorts because he wanted to and I don't mind. But when I ask to rent a motorbike together and explore the island for one day, he refused and proposed that just hire a private driver to do this. I don't really want to, since I would rather spend intimate time alone with him. How can I change his mind?
