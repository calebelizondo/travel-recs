We assume the user has python3 and pip installed. To install other package dependencies, we simply run "pip install -r requirements.txt" (the only packages that need to be download should be gensim and numpy).

First we need to build our models. To do so we simply run "python3 build-models.py". Then to query from our models we simply run "python3 query.py 'text query here'".
